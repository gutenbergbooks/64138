</div>


<p>At the request of the author, I have read this
book in proof sheets, and, from the point of
view of one interested in psychology, I have
suggested many amendments which have all, I
think, been adopted.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the intelligent reader, the
best sleep involves more than a normal body; it
involves healthy thought and the application to
our daily lives of the moral principles laid down
by our great spiritual teachers.</p>

<p>The cure of sleeplessness has hitherto been
left largely to the physician, who is not always
a specialist on that subject and who will welcome
a treatise that will enable his patient to
co-operate with his restorative measures. Mr.
Hall has already shown in <i class="cite">Three Acres and
Liberty</i> and in <i class="cite">The Garden Yard</i> his ability to
put into clear, popular language and readable
form scientific truths that non-scientific people
need to know and wish to learn.</p>

<p>The proper management of our own bodies is
even more essential to our happiness and well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>viii</span>-being
than the proper management of the land,
and I hope that this book will be no less welcome
to students and physicians than to the
great mass who for lack of knowledge or of
attention do not wholly avail themselves of the
freely offered gift of sleep.</p>

<p>The book may be useful to many who find it
difficult to harmonize their lives with their surroundings,
and may bring to many a happier
view of the ways of God to man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>This book is intended no less for those who
do sleep well than for those who do not. It is
just as important to be able to teach others
to act well as to be able to do so ourselves.
To teach we must analyze and comprehend our
own action and its motives: for being able to
do a thing well is far different from being able
to teach it. In order to teach anything we must
know how we do it and why others cannot do it.
We never know anything thoroughly until we
have tried to teach it to another.</p>

<p>Many persons sleep well only because they
are still, like little children and animals, in the
unreflective stage of life. That is the stage of
the Natural Man, and it is good in itself; but
later the mental life awakes, when consciousness
of one’s self begins, and examination of
one’s own desires develops. If not rightly understood
or if not at least accepted, that development
brings anxiety, unrest and disturbance
of sleep, and breaks the harmony of the whole
nature.</p>

<p>The highest stage of development is the spiritual,
the all-conscious state which includes and
harmonizes the other two. In that we do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>xiv</span>
lose the ready, overflowing enjoyment of our
bodily exercises and functions; rather they are
intensified; the physical and the mental are
united in the complete life.</p>

<p>In order to attain this harmony we must
examine the means that we and others use to
gain rest and peace; some of these are instinctive
and some prudential, and we must perceive
why it is that these means work or fail to work
in different cases. When, with all our getting,
we have gotten this understanding, then, and not
till then, all action becomes natural and joyful,
for then we understand it all, and follow
willingly the leading of the Spirit that is in
Man.</p>

<small>SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sancho Panza says: “Now, blessings light on him
who first invented sleep! Sleep which covers a man
all over, thoughts and all, like a cloak; and is meat
for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for the
cold, and cold for the hot. Sleep is the current coin
that purchases all the pleasures of the world cheap,
and the balance that sets the king and shepherd, the
fool and the wise man, even.”—“Don Quixote.”</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sleeping</span> is the one thing that everyone
practices almost daily all his life, and that,
nevertheless, hardly anyone does as well as
when he began. We have improved in our
walking, talking, eating, seeing, and in other
acts of skill and habit; but, in spite of our experience,
few of us have improved in sleeping:
the best sleepers only “sleep like a child.”
It must be that we do not do it wisely, else
we should by this time do it well.</p>

<p>Even the race of mankind as a whole does
not seem to be able to use sleep, to summon it,
or to control it any better than primitive man
did. We talk much of the need of sleep, and
sagely discuss its benefits, but we know neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>2</span>
how to use the faculty of sleep to the best advantage
nor how to cultivate it.</p>

<p>Yet for ages men have studied the mystery of
sleep. We have acquired many interesting
facts concerning its variation, and have formulated
a number of theories concerning its cause
and advantages; nevertheless, science has given
us little real knowledge of sleep, and less mastery
over it.</p>

<p>Mankind has had idols ever since consciousness
began. Advancing knowledge has changed
the nature and number of the idols, but it has
not destroyed them. The idol of the present
age is “Science,” and men worship it in the
degree that it seems to fit their needs. They
forget that Science is merely the knowledge of
things and persons, arranged and classified, so
as to make it available. In its nature it is
fallible, for some new phase discovered to-day
may show that yesterday’s conclusion was
formed from a theory which itself was based
on a mistaken premise. Man has caught a
glimpse of something that resembled truth, has
stated it, reasoned about it, and finally either
established its authority or disproved it utterly
through the discovery of the real thing he was
seeking. Either result was progress, because
man grows, as Browning says, “through catching
at mistake as midway help, till he reach
fact indeed.”
So there is no need to be disturbed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>3</span>
conflicting opinions of men of science touching
the purpose or method of sleep. Even the rejected
theories have added to the sum of our
knowledge, and the field for investigation is
still open to all who are faithful in noting and
comparing the manifestations of Nature, which
the scientists call phenomena.</p>

<p>Most of what we call science has to do with
physical or material things. Consequently, we
find scientists dealing mainly with what may be
called tangible phenomena, those which may be
measured or weighed or held in the hand or, at
least, pinned down by pressure of thumb or
finger.</p>

<p>Material Science’s estimate of man is largely
gauged by</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the almost inevitable result of looking
upon life as purely material or physical.
We must view life as physical, but not physical
only; as mental, but not mental only; as spiritual,
but not spiritual only.</p>

<p>In studying sleep and its attendant phenomena
all these things must be taken into consideration.
So slight a thing as fancy may
profoundly influence our acts; fancies not attributable
to any material source, so fleeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>4</span>
and evanescent that the clumsy net of language

sleep.</p>

sleep of absorbing importance, will find a place

<small>HOW MUCH SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Six hours in sleep, in law’s grave study six,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four spend in prayer, the rest on Nature fix.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(Translation.)  &nbsp;    <span class="smcap">Sir Edward Coke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Man</span>  is the highest expression yet discovered
of the “living organism,” and sleep
has always taken more of his time than any
other function. Marie de Manacéïne of St.
Petersburg, in her great book called “Sleep,” says: “The weaker the consciousness is, the
more easily it is fatigued and in need of sleep;
an energetic consciousness, on the contrary, is
contented with periods of sleep that are shorter,
less deep, and less frequent.”
Although the consciousness of the race has
developed and strengthened enormously, and is
steadily strengthening itself, the old-fashioned
idea that one-third of our time should be spent
in sleep holds the average mind as strongly as
ever. We insist upon it for the young, impress
it upon everybody, and look distrustfully upon
him who is so daring and unreasonable as to
say that he requires less than eight hours of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>6</span>
sleep. When an idea is intrenched in the mind
it is next to impossible to drive it out by reason
or even by repetition.</p>

<p>It is the popular belief that Alfred the
Great—who is also Alfred the Wise and Alfred
the Good (being dead so long)—divided
time into three equal parts, and taught that one
part should be given to sleep. If he had said
this, it would not follow that it is the last and
wisest word on the best way to divide our
time, but he did not say it. What he said
was that one-third of each day should be given
to sleep, diet and exercise: that is, that a man
should devote eight hours to sleeping, eating
and whatever form of exercise or recreation he
desired.</p>

<p>There is nothing to show that Alfred spent
even six hours in sleep, although there is plenty
of proof that he recognized the difference between
rest and sleep, for he gave the second
division of the day—eight hours—to study and
to reflection, while the remaining eight hours
were to be for business. In those days kings
worked hard. Sir Henry Sumner Maine says
that the list of places where King John held
court shows that even he was as active as any
commercial traveler nowadays. (“Early Law
and Custom,” p. 183.)</p>

<p>But the superstition that Alfred recommended
eight hours for sleep will not down,
and no amount of argument or proof will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>7</span>
change the opinion of the average man on this
point. “Our forefathers slept eight hours,” they say; “so should we.” We forget that
probably the rushlight and the candle had much
to do with the long hours of sleep in olden
times. As artificial light has improved, sleeping-time
has been shortened.</p>

<p>There is an old English quatrain which runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nature requires five,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Custom gives seven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laziness takes nine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wickedness eleven.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But sleep is a natural need, and, like any
other natural need, varies in degree in different
persons. Dogs, cats and other animals
generally sleep more than we do, and their
young ones sleep still more. Generally speaking,
the infant, whose mental powers have
barely awakened, who is, so far as we can tell,
merely a human animal, needs more sleep than
it will ever need again in its existence. In this
great need of sleep the human animal resembles
other animals.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that, as a man waxes
older, he requires less and less sleep than in
his growing and most active years. But old
people who have outlived their mental life come
to a time when they sleep and perform merely
the physical functions like the infant; so also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>8</span>
with those whose energy so far exceeds their
physical strength that the mere effort of living
exhausts them. This condition may be in part
due to overstrain of the powers of youth and
middle age, but it also follows the fixed idea
that years diminish strength and lessen energy.
It is easy to fall into this notion, for it accords
so well with the general idea that rest must
come only after the period of activity, whether
that period be a day or a lifetime.</p>

<p>All of us have had periods when we have
needed fewer than our average hours of sleep.
People who sleep out of doors or in thoroughly
ventilated rooms, under warm but light clothing,
find that they need less sleep than when they
occupy poorly ventilated rooms and wrap
themselves in heavy, unhygienic clothing. Fresh
discoveries are being made almost daily by
those who give intelligent consideration to these
things.</p>

<p>Even babies differ in their need of sleep. I
know one healthy, happy, beautiful baby who
has never slept the average sixteen hours
that babies are supposed to need. This child
is now between three and four years of age,
and has never gone to sleep before nine or half-past
nine at night. Her parents had the common
idea of long hours of sleep for infants,
and the child had a hard struggle for a while
to convince them that she had no such need:
such struggles are often called “naughtiness.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>9</span> She was regularly put to bed at seven o’clock,
and all the usual devices for enticing a baby
to sleep were practiced. Sometimes she was
left severely alone, sometimes she had gentle
lullabies sung to her, but, whether alone or in
company, this particular baby played and enjoyed
herself until between nine and nine-thirty,
when she quietly dropped to sleep. She awoke
as early as the average baby wakes, happy
and refreshed, and her parents finally learned
that there is no sleeping rule that has no
exceptions, whether applied to infants or
adults.</p>

<p>Drowsiness is a sign that we ought to sleep,
just as hunger is a sign that we ought to eat.
Natural wakefulness means that we ought not
to sleep. The child tries to obey the promptings
of nature, but we think these promptings
are wrong, if not wicked, and force him into
all sorts of bad habits. Says Michelet, “No
consecrated absurdity could have stood its
ground if the man had not silenced the objections
of the child.”
We are slowly learning that there is no
need or function of the body or of the mind
that is exactly the same in all individuals,
or that is always the same even in the same
individual.</p>

<p>But, in spite of this dawning knowledge, we
still view with alarm any disregard of the rule,
either in ourselves or another; so true it is, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>10</span>
Thomas Paine says, that “It is a faculty of the
human mind to become what it contemplates.” We have looked upon ourselves as having certain,
unvarying, imperative needs until we have
almost become subject to them.</p>

<small>THE TIME OF SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Women, like children, require more sleep normally
than men, but ‘Macfarlane states that they
can better bear the loss of sleep, and most physicians
will agree with him.’”</p>
<p class="atrib">
<span class="smcap">H. Campbell.</span>
</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>  amount of sleep, like the amount of
food, required by an individual varies
greatly, depending largely upon the conditions
at the time. Edison, for instance, can go days
without sleep when engrossed in some invention,
and he has been quoted as saying that
people sleep too much, four hours daily being
quite sufficient.</p>

<p>In answer to my inquiry, Mr. Edison’s secretary
wrote, “Mr. Edison directs me to write
you that the statement is correct, that for
thirty years he did not get four hours of sleep
per day.” Evidently, experience taught him
that an average of four hours per day, if taken
rightly and at the right time, is enough for
him. He keeps a couch in his workroom so as
to sleep when he is sleepy. He does not need
a clock to tell him when to go to bed, any more
than you need a thermometer to tell you when
to pull up the blankets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>12</span></p>

<p>Edison is not alone in his views on sleep. He
made extensive experiments with the two hundred
workers in his own factory which convinced
him and most of them that the majority
slept much too long. The hands seem to have
entered willingly into the trials: perhaps their
personal regard for him influenced their conclusions.
Napoleon Bonaparte and Frederick
of Prussia were both satisfied with four hours
of sleep,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while Bishop Taylor was of opinion
that three hours was sufficient for any man’s
needs, and Richard Baxter, who wrote “The
Saints’ Rest,” thought four hours the proper
measure.</p>

<p>Paul Leicester Ford, who was never a strong
person, once told me that he found four hours’
sleep enough for all purposes. He did not wish
to be understood as saying that four hours’
rest was enough, but four hours’ sleep. He was
one of the few who understood the difference
between sleep and rest. He frequently rested;
his favorite practice being to lie back in a big
armchair with a book, and forget the surrounding
conditions. The book created a different
set of sensations, which, combined with the
pause in physical activity, brought a sense of
rest to the frail body. He frequently got his
four hours of sleep curled up in the big chair,
and was then able to go on with the work which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>13</span>
in a few short years made him famous. The
wife of the late George T. Angell of Boston
testifies that for years he seldom slept four
hours a night, having found that, for him, more
was unnecessary; but, of course, it does not follow
that no more is necessary for anyone.</p>

<p>These are not unusual instances, but rather
typical cases. History and biography are full
of such; each of us can probably mention one
or more persons among his own acquaintance
who can do well with less than the usual eight
hours of sleep, but we have looked upon them
as exceptions and perhaps have prophesied that
they will feel the evil results later, if not now.
We usually select ourselves as the standard for
all other persons, or perhaps it is more correct
to say that we are prone to select one stage of
our own development as a standard, and try to
compel even our growing self to conform to that
stage. When the crab outgrows his shell it
sloughs off, and, so far as we know, he offers
no objection, but takes the new shell, which answers
his needs better. But we, who consider
ourselves infinitely superior to the crab, try to
compel ourselves to keep within the bounds
of old thoughts, early habits, and outgrown customs
after we no longer need them. When we
are unfortunate enough to succeed, we rejoice
at our cramped souls as the Chinese woman
prides herself upon her crushed, cramped, misshapen
foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>14</span></p>

<p>The amount of sleep that suited you last year
may not suit you to-day. You may really be
getting better sleep and so needing less of it:
or you may have to make up by quantity for a
poorer quality. The test is that, if you are
sleepy in waking hours, you need better sleep or
more of it. If you are wakeful in sleeping
hours, you need less sleep or else you are not
getting the right kind. Good sleep is a habit,
a natural habit as distinguished from an acquired
habit, and when we learn to take it naturally,
and in natural amount, we get a great
deal more from it. It is fair to assume that
purely natural habits, which continue from age
to age through all stages of human progress,
are essential to human welfare. Otherwise they
would drop away from us as many useless
physical parts have dropped. If you stop to
think of this, you know that it is so; the man
in the street and the girl at the ribbon counter
do not know, so there is more excuse for them
if they misunderstand. It may be that they
usually sleep better than you do, and so do not
need to know it.</p>

<small>WHAT SLEEP MAY MEAN</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Sleep, we are beholden to thee, Sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou bearest angels to us in the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saints out of heaven with palms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22"><span class="smcap">Jean Ingelow.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span>  know so little about sleep, positively,
that anyone may assume one thing or
another about it, so long as what he assumes
accords with what we do know positively.</p>

<p>It has been surmised that, during sleep, the
subconscious mind is busy with the day’s impressions
of the objective mind,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> fitting and relating
them to past experiences, the sum of
which makes up the man himself. The subconscious
mind is, in a sense, man’s attitude to life.
It receives suggestions more easily than the objective
mind receives them, and has more effect
upon man’s understanding of life. If our last
conscious thought is a loving thought toward
all living things, we have aided the latent mind
in its effort to get in tune with the infinite
harmony of life. Alice Herring Christopher,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>16</span>
the metaphysician, once told me that every
night as she drops off to sleep she says to herself
that she is going to have a lovely time,
and as a consequence she does; and that, on
waking, she tries to realize how delightful her
sleep has been.</p>

<p>There is an old saying that, when a baby
smiles in its sleep, it is because the angels are
whispering to it, and, if we kept ourselves
in communion with the substance of things,
“angels” might bring us sweet messages, too.
They surely will, if we drop to sleep as lovingly
and peacefully as a little child.</p>

<p>Another friend of mine, who has the faculty
of wearing herself out with the excitement of
each day’s experiences, is learning to offset this
unnecessary drain upon her strength by suggesting
to herself each night, “I shall wake
rested and refreshed in the morning.” By
this means she is gaining in nervous poise, and
averting the numerous “break-downs” from
which she used to suffer. Having made this
much progress,—which brings her “not far
from the kingdom,”—it only remains for her
to make the full claim for the fulfillment of the
promise, “Ye shall find rest to your souls,” to
secure it.</p>

<p>For the most part, men still regard sleep as
a symbol of death, that time when we shall know
nothing of what goes on about us; when, according
to general belief, we no longer grow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>17</span>
or enjoy. We exclaim with Hesiod, “Sleep—the
Brother of Death and the Son of Night!”
But the new idea of sleep as a growing time is
overcoming that old idea of sleep as death, and
is beginning to rob even the great change itself
of its terrors. We are beginning to see
that sleep does not interfere with the activity
of the mind, but simply gives it an opportunity
to digest and absorb impressions. In the same
way it may be that death does not interfere
with the activity of the real man, but may afford
him an opportunity to get the full meaning
of the experiences he had while sojourning in
the objective world.</p>

<p>As it is not conceivable that life began with
our individual appearance in this world, so it is
not likely that it will end when our individual
consciousness ceases. The sum of what we have
learned and of what we have done must go on,
else all the learning and the doing would be for
naught. So this thing which was “I”—and
will continue to be the sum of that “I,” no
matter whether I am conscious of it or not—will
use and absorb all that has been thought
or done in the body, and accept or reject its
results.</p>

<p>It will all count in that next experience, and
help us to be, as Browning says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Fearless and unperplexed</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">When I wage battle next,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What weapons to select, what armor to endue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span></p>
<p>The sum of our experiences added to the sum
of all that have gone before will help us to understand
life better when and wherever we are
again conscious of it, just as the experiences of
each day help us to live the next day better. In
the active, waking world the perceptive mind
receives impressions which the reflective mind
stores up and brings to bear upon our daily life
and thought, thus developing greater consciousness
in the individual; so the interruption of
all physical activity may be necessary to the
further development of the real and intangible
man.</p>

<p>As one awakes each morning from a night’s
sleep a new man, physically and mentally, although
not necessarily aware of any change,
so may our awakening be from the last sleep
that men call death. It may be that we shall
arise to new experiences, or perhaps to further
development in a world that we cannot touch
with our hands. But in either case we may not
doubt that the awakening will be good, for all
life is good. For, after all, we should know
none of the joys of living if we had not tried
them. Life is consciousness, and hardly one
of us would prefer never to have lived; to have
had no share in that which has meant <i class="em">man</i>;
the growth and culmination of unnumbered
centuries. Life is one, a whole, and the
“slings and arrows” of daily worries and toil
are only an unimportant part of it. And, if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>19</span>
is so good that we wish to stay here and hope
to enjoy it, if we can see how it has steadily improved
and beautified in the ages that have
passed, we cannot fail to see that all it may
yet become will also be good.</p>

<small>HOW TO GO TO SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Sleep sweetly, tender heart in peace!<br />
<span class="smcap">Tennyson.</span>
</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Man</span>  craves sleep. If we know of a friend
who is suffering in body or mind we wish
him sleep; mothers soothe their pain-racked or
terrified children to sleep with every gentle art
known to them; if, for any reason, man is out
of harmony with his life as he sees it, he instinctively
turns to “Nature’s sweet restorer.” It is a sovereign balm for many ills, yet we seldom
recognize wherein its virtue lies. During
his waking hours man is frequently at odds
with his surroundings. He is out of tune with
the real things of life and is apt to mistake the
material side of his life for the whole of his
being. But when sleeping he is less hampered
with the impressions of the workaday world,
less resistant, and, therefore, more harmonious.
It is in this mental relaxation that the true
benefit of sleep consists.</p>

<p>We have as yet no conception of the immense
import of suggestion to ourselves or others as
a cure for body or mind. Suggestions may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>21</span>
often be made to a person sound asleep, but they
are most effective just at the time when the
reason and the will are losing control of the
mind, although consciousness has not yet lost
its grip.</p>

<p>Accordingly it helps our growth to relax the
whole nature before going to sleep and to drop
into the mind the thought of peace and harmony;
the assurance that all is and must be
well. To do this is to get the best sort of
sleep, the sleep that binds us closer to our fellows
and makes us feel the oneness of all life.
This is the sleep from which we awake refreshed,
ready to take up the day’s duties cheerfully.
It is an old country saying, when a person
seems what is called “out of sorts” in the
morning, that “he got out on the wrong side
of the bed.” But it is much more likely that
he went to sleep in the wrong way: that is, in
an unloving frame of mind.</p>

<p>“Let not the sun go down upon your wrath” has a wider significance than we usually realize.
As a matter of mere physical well-being,
if we have allowed the lack of knowledge or the
selfishness of our brother to annoy or irritate
us, it is well to wipe away all traces of that
irritation before lying down to rest. It is well,
when possible, to seek the “little one” we
have offended, through our own ignorance or
selfishness, and make our peace by confessing
the fault; while, if we are still self-centered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>22</span>
enough to feel that our brother has dealt
harshly with us, we may remove all the sting by
thinking lovingly of him. As the soft answer
turneth away wrath, so the soft attitude turneth
out wrath, both from ourselves and from
him. Each day should complete itself. Sufficient
unto the day is the good and the evil
thereof, and to attempt to carry over the evil
through resentment until another day is but to
lay up trouble for ourselves.</p>

<p>For, after all, it is lack of knowledge or understanding
that makes our brother unkind to
us or us to him. Each is doing the best he
can, being such a man as he is. Each of us has
still some of that separateness which makes us
regard our own interests as apart from other
interests, or hostile to them. What our brother
does, therefore, he does because it seems to
him the best thing for himself. As soon as he
sees that one cannot truly prosper at the expense
of another, because we are all one, he
will give up his stupid ways—as we shall give
up our stupid ways when we see that same
truth. Until then it is useless to be angry or
upset, for that is only to show that we, too,
are unable to see the oneness of all. As it is
bad for our brother that he is so blind, it were
more consistent that we should feel sorrow than
anger at his self-injury.</p>

<p>Epictetus understood that, nineteen hundred
years ago, and we have not become so stupid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>23</span>
as to deny it; we only forget. He saw that
there is only one kind of motive in all men—they
are moved by what they think is right and
best for themselves. Said he, “It is impossible
to judge one thing best for me and to seek
a different one, to judge one thing right and be
inclined towards another.” We all know this
about ourselves, but we do not see it so plainly
about others.</p>

<p>If we felt this about all men, we should not
have “indignation with the multitude.” For
what are all their wrongdoings? Is it not that
they are “mistaken about the things that are
good and evil? Shall we then be indignant
with them, or shall we only pity them?...
Show them the error and we shall see how they
will cease from it when they really see it. But,
if they do not see the error, they have naught
better than the deceptive appearance of the
thing as it looks to them.”
For, argues Epictetus, “this man who errs
and is deceived concerning things of the greatest
moment is blinded, not in the vision that
distinguished black and white, but in the judgment
which distinguished Good and Evil....
If it is the greatest misfortune to be deprived
of the greatest things, and the greatest thing
in every man is a <i class="em">Will</i> such as he ought to
have, and if one be deprived of this, why are
we still indignant with him?... We need not
be moved contrary to Nature by the evil deed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>24</span>s
of other men. Pity them rather, be not inclined
to offense and hatred.... When someone
may do us an injury or speak ill of us,
remember that he does it or speaks it, believing
that it is meet and best for him to do so. It
is not possible, then, that he can do the thing
that appears best to you, but the thing that
appears best to him. Wherefore, if good appears
evil to him, it is he that is injured, being
deceived. For, if anyone takes a true consequence
to be false, it is not the consequence that
is injured, but he is injured who is deceived.
Setting out, then, with these opinions, you will
bear a gentle mind toward any man who may
injure you. For, say on each occasion, ‘so it
appeared to him.’”
Forgive: and if you must blame somebody,
blame yourself—you can forgive yourself so
easily.</p>

<p>So we shall find sleep more restful if we
leave behind us all the shortcomings of ourselves
and of our fellows, and approach that
season of seeming forgetfulness with love towards
all. Calm as an infant’s sleep will be
the slumber of the all-loving man, and for him
the new day will dawn with increased brightness;
his strength shall be renewed, and his
joy be more abundant.</p>

<p>If we always lie down to sleep with this attitude,
regarding the darkness not merely as the
time when the physical man should rest, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>25</span>
also as a growing time for the spiritual man,
it will not be long before we adjust our daily
life to more harmonious relations with the universe.
The more lovingly we live, the sweeter
and sounder will be our slumber, for so it is
that “He giveth his beloved sleep.”</p>

<small>SLEEP IS NATURAL</small></h2></div>


<p class="center">Sleep is the joy of life.<br />

<span class="smcap">Wu Ting Fang.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Man</span>  has not gone so far beyond the animal
stage of development as to have cast
aside all the weights that hinder him in his
further progress. He has considered three substantial
meals daily necessary to his health, and
if, for any reason, his system refused to take
that quantity of food, he has worried himself
almost into a fever over it. Or, he has consulted
a physician who has usually given him
a tonic; a tonic is something to stimulate the
jaded appetite, or compel the surfeited stomach
to do more work than it should.</p>

<p>Recent research has shown that this overworking
of the digestive organs is a fruitful
source of physical disease, that it dulls the
mind and chills the spirit. Our loving Mother
Nature punishes each excess, because pain
quickest draws our attention to our wrongdoing.
The flesh strives with us as well as the
Spirit, for we reap in our own bodies the fruit
of our ways; still man looks everywhere but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span>
within for advice and counsel. His feelings
may warn him that he is pursuing the wrong
course, but, until some authority has assured
him that he is doing wrong, he rarely pays heed
to his inner warnings.</p>

<p>Gluttony is one of the evils which Nature tries
to save man from. The stomach rebels when
it is made to dispose of too much material, and
calls in the rest of the body to assist in making
a protest. The head aches, the heart works uneasily,
the liver and bowels become inactive, the
limbs grow heavy, and the whole abused man
is ill at ease. A bad breath is worse than an
evil spirit, and a bad digestion is a surer sign
of ill-doing than a bad conscience. Nature has
done her best to show the foolishness of overeating;
it is not her fault if man persists in this
course in spite of her warnings, but she takes
care that he pays the price of his wrongdoing,
sometimes in sleeplessness, often in even more
serious ways.</p>

<p>Overeating has been the fashion for centuries.
We have thought that, the more we eat,
the stronger we should become, and mankind
has followed that fashion despite the ills that
it has caused, forgetting that it is what we digest,
not what we eat, that nourishes. The effects
of overeating are both direct and indirect.
The direct effects are those that dog the
heels of the offense. These effects, when acute,
have even caused death in a few hours or days,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>28</span>
as with King John and his “dish of lamprey
eels,” but some of the indirect effects are more
direful. Much of the use of alcoholic liquors
is due to overeating. When we have eaten too
much, and the digestive organs are so overloaded
that they cannot work, we take alcohol
in some form to stimulate them to greater action.
As we continue the wrong practice, it
requires more and more liquor to stimulate us,
usually ending in stupor, a parody of sleep. In
a short time that which we used to cure or offset
one evil has created a habit, in itself a
greater evil.</p>

<p>It took us a long time to see the connection
between illness, drunkenness, and overeating.
We now know that drink becomes a habit and
after that a disease. If we look at mankind
in the mass, drunkenness appears plainly as the
result of two general causes, overstimulation of
the indulgent classes, and the malnutrition that
craves stimulants in the masses of the underfed.</p>

<p>Like every other faculty, consciousness becomes
dulled through lack of exercise. It follows
that oversleeping inclines to dullness and
stupidity. Further, the body will readily accommodate
itself to the physiological conditions
that prevail during sleep, to a changed blood
circulation, and breathing. The oversleeping
may come to resemble the hibernation of some
animals. For those inclined to drowsiness or
to unnaturally long sleep, real interests in life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>29</span>
are helpful, also amusements, pleasant society
in the evenings, and even tea and coffee or other
mild stimulants are useful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some people, at least, think they
suffer from insomnia, who in fact suffer from
going to bed too soon or lying abed too late—in
the struggle to sleep more than they need.</p>

<small>THE DUPLEX MIND</small></h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span>  must not forget that it is easy to miss
the good results of any natural function,
and, through misuse, get only poor results.
As in the matter of eating, we should get only
good from satisfying our hunger, but the acquired
habit of eating more than we need or
can digest does incalculable harm. In the same
way we may misuse sleep, and so lose its best
benefits.</p>

<p>“Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of
care,” may be made, as Shakespeare says, a
repairing time as well as a resting time, for as
Iamblichus, the Neo-Platonic philosopher saw,
“The night-time of the body is the daytime of
the soul.” With some insight into the best uses
of this natural habit, Iamblichus further said
that, during sleep, “the nobler part of the soul
is united by abstraction to higher natures and
becomes a participant in the wisdom and foreknowledge
of the gods.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>31</span>
Dr. Thomas J. Hudson’s claim made a very
popular appeal, that there is a subjective mind
made up of our inner knowledge, our own intuitions
and mental processes. He alleged it
to be a part of our being that is able, in some
instances—as in the case of “lightning calculators,” of mind-readers and of some clairvoyants—to
perceive the relations of things without
reasoning them out, and to perceive the
fixed laws of Nature without the aid of the
senses.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He concluded that this mind or this
faculty of mind is an inheritance from experiences
and conclusions of the race in its upward
growth.</p>

<p>Swedenborg also, who was at least a noted
scientist, divided the mind into the Interior,
corresponding to the subjective mind, and the
Exterior or reasoning memory.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The objective mind, as it may be called,
is what we all know as mind or intellect, that
part which deals with external objects, getting
its impressions and reaching its conclusions
from observation. It is differently affected in
different individuals by such purely physical
things as sight and hearing. For a proof of
this, ask any two persons who have seen and
heard and been affected by something you have
seen and felt, to describe its effect upon them,
and the mental picture they have of it. Not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>32</span>
only will they not agree in detail with each
other, but you will find that neither has seen
it in the same way that you have.</p>

<p>Modern science cannot accept the statement
that foreign, mysterious agencies control the
mind during sleep; but may not some such experience
as that which Iamblichus describes,
come to us in sleep by the spirit working, not
from without, but from within us? Our spiritual
nature is freed at night from the incessant
calls that beset us during the day. In the calm
that comes over it in the night-time the doors
of the storehouses of memory may stand wide
open before it, and it may lead perhaps a
broader, fuller life.</p>

<p>Professor William James has shown that in
our waking hours, each of us is not so much
a single self as a cluster of separate selves—a
business self, social self, the material self, and
so on—all making up the man as his casual
acquaintances know him. Professor James
found that in every individual there is rivalry
and sometimes discord among these partial
selves. Now may it not be that in the
silence, these warring factions lose their identity
in a state of broader conscious life, and
merge themselves into a harmoniously acting
“Spiritual Me”?</p>

<p>From the standpoint of this spiritual self,
then, the waking state shows only the objective
aspects of the mind. It is that understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>33</span>
which shows us all men working, whether willingly
or unwillingly, for the common good, and
each receiving what he needs or has power to
use. It is a recognition that all men are comprehended
in the Spirit’s plan, that nothing
can be for the common harm; that even mistakes
work out for good, and that life gives
to each the experience from which he will get
most development and the power which he can
best use and relate to his whole life. From
the spiritual standpoint the subjective mind is
the indwelling life of the soul; and its growth
a matter of gradual self-attainment. At its
highest stage it is the realization of that which
we have in common with everyone—that understanding
and that consciousness of the law of
harmony which makes us love all mankind, and
live in communion with the love that is the
substance of all things. The separate self does
not appear at all on the horizon of such thought
and purpose.</p>

<p>We have all had a consciousness of this love
at some time in our lives, no matter how the
cares of the world may have choked it out. It
was this consciousness that made a little boy
say, in a burst of happiness, “I love everything,
and everything loves me.” When we
“become like a little child” in this sense, we,
too, recognize the love that binds all life in
one.</p>

<p>When we can harmonize these two—the sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span>conscious,
that knows no separate self, with the
objective, that can see all men as one because
it sees all men as working for the same end—we
shall have rest and harmony instead of
worry, the insanity of the spiritual mind.</p>

<p>The objective mind which is active during
waking hours, apparently rests during sleep;
the subconscious mind is ever busy. Like the
heart or the digestive organs, the subconscious
mind carries on its work during that break in
our usual consciousness which we call sleep.
How this is done we do not know, any more
than we know how the physical organs carry
on their work while we are wrapped in slumber
and unconscious of all about us. There are
very few, though, who have not had some proof
of the activity of the latent mind during sleep.
That somehow this under-mind does work in an
“uncanny” way—that is to say, in an unknown
way—is shown by the fact that most
persons can wake up at any hour that they fix
in their minds without being called and without
the abominable alarm clock.</p>

<p>It is a common enough thing to hear people
say, “I do not know how I knew that; I never
remember hearing it; it just came to me.” Or,
“I tried and tried to think of that yesterday,
and could not, but, when I woke this morning, it
was the first thing that came to my mind.” Such incidents show that some process of which
we are not objectively conscious is going on all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>35</span>
the time; that no mental experience is destroyed
or wholly dissipated. The common wish is “to
sleep over” any perplexing matter. After a
good sleep our ideas are often better arranged
than when we fell asleep.</p>

<p>I have a friend who drops all her problems
into her subconscious thought, refuses to be
“exercised in her mind” about them, and
leaves them for the latent mind to answer. So
long as she views them from the objective, conscious
point of view only, she finds herself
worrying and losing sleep. The sleep-won mind,
the “all-knowing Self,” as it were, is not
touched by worry, perhaps because, in communion
with the substance of all experience, it
perceives that there are few “problems” in
life, when she does not persist in regarding as a
“problem” each separate experience.</p>

<p>We must learn to connect each experience
with what we know of our life up to that point
and with what we think it is meant to be. This
effort will often show us, or itself prove to be,
the key to the “problem.”
But it is only the scientific expert, one who
has a perfect conception of the workings of all
the parts of the frame, who can take one bone
and reconstruct from it the entire structure of
the extinct animal. That would be impossible
for the tyro, and most of us are tyros in the
science of living.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>  fact that we confound rest and sleep
makes us regard wakefulness as an evil.
We go to bed to sleep, and, if sleep does not
come at once, we begin to fret and to toss and
we try by every means that we know to force
ourselves to sleep. We never accomplish anything
that way, because it is essentially opposed
to the nature of sleep. Sleep, to be refreshing,
must be complete relaxation of mind and body,
and that is not gained by striving. Natural
sleep is merely “letting go,” which is just what
so many find hard to do. The course is so simple
and plain that “the wayfaring man, though
a fool, <i class="em">need</i> not err therein,” but he often does
err in spite of its simplicity; and sometimes,
perhaps, even because of its simplicity.</p>

<p>Naaman, captain of the host of Syria, went
to the Israelitish prophet, Elisha, to be cured
of his leprosy. As he was a great man with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>37</span>
master, he expected some special ceremony done
for him. Imagine his surprise and wrath when
bidden to wash in the River Jordan.</p>

<p>At first Naaman went away in a rage; such
advice ill-befitted his ideas of his needs. If it
were enough that he should bathe in a river,
why in Jordan? “Are not Abana and Pharpar,
rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters
of Israel?” Why not wash in them and
be clean? And Naaman turned and went away.</p>

<p>But his servants questioned him and said:
“Had the prophet bid thee do some great
thing, wouldst thou not have done it? How
much rather then when he saith to thee ‘wash
and be clean’?” Then Naaman yielded and
was made whole.</p>

<p>This story is a picture of our own ways. We
despise the remedy that is simple, and we feel
sure that, had it been some great thing, we
should have found it easier to do. We are unwilling
to accept simple, natural explanations
of our difficulties. We feel so because we think
so highly of ourselves. We forget that the
greatest things are often the simplest, and, if
the natural things are too hard for us to do,
it is because we lack that true greatness which
sees and welcomes directness.</p>

<p>If man understood his life better, he would
cease to think of anything as an “accident” without a cause. He would know that nothing
can occur to him that does not signify some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span>thing
to him in relation to his share in the plan
of the Universe. He would understand that so
simple a thing as whether or not he shall fall
asleep as soon as he lies down to rest, or
whether he shall find that “sleep has forsaken
his eyes and slumber his eyelids,” may be an
experience of great importance to him.</p>

<p>Every incident of life is subject to law; yet
many of the most important functions of the
body are performed without any consciousness
of their relation and dependence one upon another:
as, for instance, breathing upon the circulation
of the blood, which in turn depends
upon the heart’s pumping, and that upon the
digestion, and that upon the food, and so on;
the same is true of mental activities, and must
be true of spiritual activities, for the same law
runs through all of life. The wakefulness
surely has some cause and some significance,
else it had not been.</p>

<p>When something “goes wrong,” we are
forced to look into our case, and note the relation
of one state of mind or body to other
states. It is then, if ever, that we learn which
is cause and which is effect; how mistakes result
in pain and pain warns us of mistakes, and
how one necessarily follows the other. If it
were not for the pain that follows the violation
of some natural law, man might go on in
his unwise course until he had altogether destroyed
his physical body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>39</span></p>

<p>It is the pain from the burn on the tiny hand
that warns the infant not again to touch what
he is told is “hot.” If fire did not pain the
body, we might be destroyed by flames without
making any effort to escape. In fact, the chilliness
and numbness of the African “sleeping
sickness” often lead patients actually to burn
off their hands or feet in the effort to get warm.
It is quite possible that, if there were no pains
in child-birth, women would bear children continually
until they were themselves exhausted
or their progeny overran one another. It is
pain that tells us that a tooth is decayed, so
that even toothache may be a blessing.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we are wise, instead of rebelling
against pain, we should accept it gratefully
as the helper and the possible preserver
of our lives, and we should accept the wakefulness
quietly as the sign of something that needs
correction, or else as an opportunity for quiet
thought and reflection.</p>

<p>When we have found what is wrong, and do
our best to correct it, not only is the attention
drawn from the pain to the remedy, but the
effort to relieve it lessens the effect of the
suffering.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<small>SIMPLE CAUSES OF WAKEFULNESS</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">Where care lodges, sleep will never lie.<br />

<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> all know the blessing of sleep, but it is
hard to show the sufferer that wakefulness
is useful.</p>

<p>Wakefulness always has some cause, and, if
we truly wish to be cured of it, it will be well
to seek the cause rather than to grumble at the
wakefulness itself. It is not enough to know what
is the matter, we must find out why it is the
matter. To find the cause of any condition
simplifies matters; it makes the course we must
follow clearer. If the cause can be removed,
we should bend all our energies to removing it;
to paraphrase Stephen Pearl Andrews’ saying—we
are not to be subject to circumstances,
but rather to make ourselves center-stances.
But, if the matter be something over which we
have no control, there are two courses open to
us: the first is to accept the condition and adapt
ourselves to it; the second is to devise some
method by which we may gain control over it.</p>

<p>A childish story<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> will illustrate this:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>41</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once there was a squirrel that did not like
its home, and it used to scold and find fault
with everything. Its papa squirrel had long
gray whiskers, so he was wise. He said to the
squirrel: “My dear, as you do not like your
home, there are three sensible things you could
do:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Leave it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or Change it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or Suit yourself to it.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Any one of these would help you in your
trouble.”
But the little squirrel said, “Oh! I do not
want to do any of those; I had rather sit on
the branch of a tree and scold.”
“Well,” said the papa squirrel, “if you
must do that, whenever you want to scold, just
go out on a branch and scold away at someone
you do not know.”
The little squirrel blushed so much that he
became a red squirrel, and you will notice that
to this day red squirrels do just that thing.</p></div>

<p>Whatever course we pursue, we find something
to do in connection with the underlying
principle or cause; this <i class="em">doing</i> prevents us
from wasting energy and patience upon mere
effects. That is an advantage, for any action
relieves mental pain, and often relieves physical
pain, too. The victim writhes not only in
its effort to escape, but in the effort to express<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>42</span>
its feeling, to respond to the excited nerves, just
as we dance about or hop up and down when
we hit our finger with the hammer. We often
hear people deplore that their suffering is increased
because they can do nothing to remedy
the trouble. We frequently exclaim, “It would
be easier to bear, if only I could <i class="em">do</i> something.” A knowledge of what to do and how to do it
always helps toward peace of mind.</p>

<p>When yellow fever was one of the “mysterious
dispensations of Providence,” men of science
fought only its symptoms, with very indifferent
success. The people in the district
where the fever broke out were panic-stricken;
those who could fled from the place; those who
were compelled to remain went about in fear of
their lives. Now that we believe that the bite
of an infected mosquito is the once “mysterious
dispensation,” we no longer allow the infection
to spread. Fear and unreason might
have continued to treat outbreaks and epidemics
of yellow fever for centuries to come without
lasting advantage to the plague-ridden
spots, but the knowledge of what to do and how
to do it has made yellow fever a preventable evil.
It has no terrors for an intelligent community.</p>

<p>So with wakefulness. If we find ourselves
wakeful when we should be sleeping, the first
thing to do is to find the reason.</p>

<p>Sometimes we cause our own sleeplessness
unsuspectingly, but none the less deliberately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span>
by the false requirements that we lay upon ourselves.
People often say, “I could not go to
sleep in a room like that.” If there is time
and opportunity to put the room in order, why
do it; but, if not, we can resolve, as the boys
say, to “forget it.”
Many a woman frets and disturbs herself
continually by putting things in what she considers
order, which things are no better for being
rearranged and which generally cannot stay in
order—endless pushing in of chairs and placing
pamphlets or books with the little ones on
top and the big ones at the bottom; a constant
and wearisome struggle to keep all the shades
in the house in a line. The labor of Sisyphus,
who had forever to roll a great stone up a sand
hill, would be restful compared with that. I
knew a man once who would be entirely upset,
and would upset all the people about him, if his
stockings that came from the wash were not
placed below those in the drawer so that they
would surely be used in rotation.</p>

<p>Some persons cannot sleep after dawn if the
light shines on their faces, yet are so possessed
by the idea of order that they will not move
the bed, disarrange the furniture to make a
screen, or even sleep with their heads at the
foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Another person insists always on being
waked up by the last person to come home in
order to be sure that the house was closed up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>44</span>
Still another cannot go to sleep till he has balanced
up every cent of petty cash spent that
day.</p>

<p>Many persons spend the most of their
thought and exhaust themselves over things
that are just as trivial and inconsequent as
these; though they seem important to them.
When anything has become such a habit, even
though reasonable in itself, that you cannot
sleep without it, you are paying too dear for
it and it is time to change it. There is danger
even in good habits—they may master us.</p>

<p>It may be that we have had some stimulating
mental experience which has not yet relaxed its
grip upon our attention. In such case even
bodily weariness is apt to be forgotten, for,
after all, every physical sensation is dependent
upon some mental condition, whether fleeting
or permanent. It is this interdependence of
physical feeling and thought which makes it
possible to recall emotions of pain or sorrow,
of comfort or joy. The sight, the touch, or the
smell of certain things will bring back sensations
that once accompanied them, whether
those sensations be painful or pleasant.</p>

<p>If the mind has been so stimulated that it
cannot relax, there is little likelihood that sleep
will come quickly, but we cannot relax by impatience.
Tossing and turning will not quiet the
mind; we must either accept the condition
calmly and follow out the train of thought that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>45</span>
has started or deliberately side-track the exciting
cause. This may be done by setting up a
counter activity in the mind along quieting
lines. For instance, if one had walked the
streets late on some such occasion as a New
Year’s Eve celebration in New York, and had
become stimulated by the lights and the crowds,
he might deliberately recall the most peaceful
day in the country that it had been his fortune
ever to know.</p>

<p>A typical scene of this sort is a warm Sunday
in late spring, when all the usual activities of
country life have ceased; the air is heavy with
the scent of clover and field flowers, the apple
blossoms, and the thousand odors of the fresh
country field; the air moving so lazily that it
scarcely stirs the trees; the cow chewing the
meditative cud; the bees buzzing dreamily; the
very horses, standing under the shed of the little
white country church, whinnying softly to
each other, as knowing that a spell of peace is
over all, a spell that must not be broken; while
from the church itself comes the drone of the
preacher,—each little stir a part of the peace
that broods over the day. Think of some such
thing as that, recall it in all its details, and the
chances are that the drowsiness induced at the
time, whether one were of the congregation or
a mere onlooker, will again steal over the eyelids
and, before one is aware of any change,
he is well on the way to the land of dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>46</span></p>

<p>In the same way if one has read an exciting
book, or has seen a thrilling play, one may
either live them over until the feelings exhaust
themselves, because no longer new, or one
may deliberately divert one’s self from thinking
of them and devote the attention to more soothing
things. Either course removes all cause for
impatience with the fact of wakefulness and
leaves the mind quieted. This tends to drowsiness,
even if it does not really induce sleep.</p>

<p>Sometimes it may help us if we rise and read
some quieting book, not “a thriller.” Such a
volume as Thoreau’s “Walden,” or that more
modern little volume, “Adventures in Contentment,” by David Grayson, or we may repeat
some soothing poem like Tennyson’s “Sweet
and Low,” or Burroughs’ “My Own Shall
Come to Me” and similar verses.</p>

<p>Any of these will help to relax tension, and
put us in a more restful frame of mind, and, as
minds differ, so some persons will find books
and verses of other sorts to have the desired
effect upon them.</p>

<p>When we cannot sleep, to rise, throw back
the bed-clothes so as to cool the bed, walk about
the room, go to the window and fill the lungs
with oxygen often tend to quiet the body and
mind. We must learn to know our own needs
and to find out each for himself what meets
them. To “know thyself” is only the first step
to control thyself.</p>

<small>“LIGHT” SLEEPERS</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">He sleeps well who knows not that he sleeps ill.<br />

<span class="smcap">Publius Syrus</span> (42 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>).</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Someone</span>  may say that such things as
stimulation of the mind are simple causes
of wakefulness, and so easily overcome that it
is hardly necessary to consider them; yet, simple
as they are, they frequently make the wakeful
one impatient. The more complex causes
are really as easily dealt with as these simple
ones, when once we have learned to control the
mind. Take, for instance, the complaining
“light sleeper” who cannot sleep if anybody
else makes a noise, or if anything out of the
ordinary occurs. He is in a steady state of
apprehension lest something will happen to
disturb his rest; and generally something does
happen. A baby cries, a dog barks, a heavily-laden
team lumbers by, an automobile honks,
a locomotive shrieks, or a steamer whistles, and
sleep forsakes him for the night.</p>

<p>He pronounces anathema on the offending
cause; he pities himself for his sensitiveness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>48</span>
at the same time that he almost despises his
fellows who are so “dead and unresponsive
that they can sleep through such a racket”  he
suffers at the thought that he may get no more
sleep, yet he enjoys the prospect of rehearsing
to a sympathizing audience in the morning the
tortures of such a delicate organization as his.
This sort of sleeplessness is made up of so
many contributing causes that it is difficult for
any but the most perfectly honest man to decide
what makes him so susceptible to noise.
But it is undoubtedly true that some of these
causes are due to fear, to training, and, most
of all, to self-interest.</p>

<p>It is always difficult to make the super-sensitive
person realize that his suffering is due
chiefly to self-consideration and a desire to control
others. It is an undue recognition of one’s
own claim upon the very circumstances of life
that makes one offer so many surfaces which
may be “hurt.” We may be disturbed in our
sleep by the ordinary pursuits of our fellows
because we have an exaggerated idea of the
importance of certain conditions that appeal to
us and make for our comfort. We wish to sleep
at a certain time, and we should like to regulate
all our neighbors so that they, too, should suspend
all activities at that same time. We accustom
ourselves to quiet; and then insist that
we cannot do without it.</p>

<p>There is a story told of a man working in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span>
foundry who formed a part of two “shifts” of
workmen and betweenwhiles slept for some
hours in the foundry. When released from that
strain, he found that he could not sleep at home
because it was so quiet, and it became necessary
for the members of his family to unite in making
ringing, pounding noises to lull him to
slumber.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that those who live
near the cataracts of the Nile cannot sleep if
they get beyond the sound of the pounding.
Soldiers, who are wearied after a hard day’s
march or fighting, will sleep soundly beside
twenty-four pounder guns steadily firing; or
even sleep on the march, their legs moving mechanically
though their senses are steeped in
sleep.</p>

<p>Country people coming to the city are kept
awake by the unusual street noises, while city-dwellers,
accustomed to the roar of elevated
or subway trains, are unable to sleep in the
country because of the intense silence which
Nature’s noises often emphasize.</p>

<p>Unreflecting man is a creature of habit: if
any change occurs in his routine, he finds it
difficult to adapt himself to it. He seldom
comes to understand that it is chiefly insistence
upon his own needs as apart from the needs
or interests of others that makes him require
certain conditions for sleeping. In either case
the cause of wakefulness is easily found; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>50</span>
nobody other than the individual most concerned
can remove it.</p>

<p>If we are living in selfish disharmony with our
fellows; if we are indulging feelings of envy,
malice, uncharitableness or hatred towards
those about us, we are not likely to sleep refreshingly.
All such emotions do more harm
to the one who feels them than to those against
whom they are directed. They may undermine
the health, destroy the mental poise, and blot
out the sense of kinship with mankind. The
Hebrews understood that so well that he who
would offer a sacrifice is reminded that, if he
have aught against his brother, he must leave
his gift at the altar and make his peace before
he can offer an acceptable sacrifice to God.</p>

<p>If wakefulness be the result of impatience
with our brother, there is only one cure for it:
that is, to replace it with loving patience. It
is the lack of love, or the possession of very
narrow love, that causes us pain in our relations
with other people.</p>

<small>THE GIFTS OF WAKEFULNESS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">“B<span class="smcap">ut,</span>” you say, “I am not full of uncharitableness
towards my fellows and I
am willing they should live their own lives; I
am greatly worried about my own affairs and
all my cares come trooping back to me as soon
as I lie down. I cannot sleep for worry.”
Yes; but is not that only another form of
selfishness? A subtle form, but none the less
disturbing. Moreover, it is shortsighted, as is
all selfishness, for it is a boomerang. If the
worry is about business, we shall need a clear
brain and a steady nerve to face the condition
that is causing the uneasiness; and worry at
night will not give us these. On the contrary,
it will destroy what remnant of poise we may
have.</p>

<p>The solution of trouble is not found in worry.
Just recall how often you have said yourself,
or heard somebody say, “After all my worrying
it came out all right; it is strange that I
never once thought of that way.” Worry prevents
clear thinking, or, indeed, thinking of any
sort. We go around and around in a circle un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>52</span>til
we grow giddy and faint with apprehension,
while all the time we might have peace if we
but looked at life aright, to see that, in the
words of the old Book, “it is all very good.”
When a mechanic is putting a machine together
and finds that the parts do not fit, that
they do not “go right” or harmonize, he will
reach one of two conclusions. Either the maker
did not know his business, and so did not make
the parts to fit, or else he, himself, is putting
them together in the wrong way. If he wants
to put that machine together so that it will
work well, he will look into the matter carefully,
examining each part, all the time keeping
in his mind a conception of the complete machine.
He will probably find that he has been
trying to fit two unrelated parts together, or has
reversed their position, misunderstood or only
partially understood their uses, or has done
something through carelessness that may easily
be corrected. Of course, if he is a stupid or
foolish workman, and not a skilled mechanic, he
may persist in his wrong course and fail to
get the machine into working order. But that
is not the fault of the maker, nor does it prove
that the machine would not do perfect work
if it were rightly understood and intelligently
controlled. So it is with the Cosmos, the orderly
world, which will go right for us if we
do our part right.</p>

<p>The first step towards knowing how to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>53</span>
anything is to have a clear idea of what it is
that we want; for development is not thrust
upon us, nor dropped upon us by our parents.
It is desire that creates function; the creature
that wants to swim is the creature that learns
to swim; the bird that does not want to fly will
lose the power; before we can rise higher, we
must look higher.</p>

<p>“When the ideal once alights in our streets,” says Edward Carpenter, “we may go home to
supper in peace, the rest will be seen to.”
But, if we enjoy worry as the countryman’s
wife “enjoys poor health,” we shall continue
to have it, for we always get what we most
want, if we set about it in the right way. And
if we do not want worry, we need not worry.
If the trouble is unavoidable or unchangeable,
it were wise to use our powers to adjust ourselves
to the inevitable. If it be a curable
trouble, the only thing is to discover or devise
a cure. As soon as we start to work we cease
to worry, because worry and effective activity
cannot exist at the same time. Man, at least, is
such a creature that any real action looking towards
a definite end brings him pleasure; and,
though the action may have been stimulated by
pain, yet the pleasure he finds in the action
mitigates, if it does not destroy, the pain.</p>

<p>If the original cause for the worry lies in our
own ignorance, selfishness, or thoughtlessness,
the anxiety may teach us to repair the ill so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>54</span>
we may not have to get the same lesson again.
But worrying will teach us less than a cheerful
acceptance of the facts—or than that courage
which says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And still the menace of the years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Finds and shall find me unafraid”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">and one of the best aids to cheerfulness is
sound, refreshing sleep. If we should put off
all worrying until the morning, there would be
very little worrying done by the normal, healthy
person, for, after a good night’s sleep and in
the clear light of day, things look much better
than they did in the darkness and solitude of
the night, with mind and body worn from the
activities of the day.</p>

<p>If we feel that our affairs are too important
to be left to the care of the Providence that
keepeth Israel, and slumbers not nor sleeps,
then at least we may wait until morning to give
our attention to them. It is unfair to bring
exhausted faculties to bear upon matters of so
great weight. If our troubles can be helped by
worrying, we should worry when we are in the
best possible trim. To do less were to underestimate
their importance and to prove that,
anyway, they are not worth losing sleep over.</p>

<p>But there is still another way of looking at
wakefulness, when we cannot trace the cause of
it. It may be the time sent to us by the Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>55</span>
for quiet thought. The ancients believed that
God spoke in visions of the night. We may not
always be able to sleep, but we can always lie
in the arms of our Great Mother Nature. There
is a real philosophy as well as devotion in the
old prayer we teach our children, “Now I lay
me down to sleep.” A still older form of the
almost instinctive recognition of the fact that
sleeping is but intrusting ourselves to the Universal
love was, “He committed himself to
God in sleep.”
Like sleep, a wakeful night may be a growing
time. It affords the quiet, the time, the seclusion
to think over the meanings of things,
or even to seek the cause of the wakefulness itself.
For that is the first thing to do if we
find ourselves wakeful; if the cause be so obscure
that we cannot find it, then the best thing
to do is to accept the fact.</p>

<p>Either we do not need the sleep we are seeking,—the
reclining position being all the <i class="em">rest</i>
the body needs,—or else we do need the wakefulness
to teach us something that we can learn
or will learn in no other way. It is a time
when, free from the watchful eyes of those who
love us, or those who do not love us, we need
not fear to look at ourselves, our motives, our
relations to our fellows.</p>

<p>It may be only at such a time that we can feel
the closeness of the tie that binds all mankind,
only in such a time that a life-giving sense of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>56</span>
oneness can renew life and joy. Some persons
are so acutely conscious of the surge around
them during the day that it is difficult, if not
impossible, for them to get any large view of
it. They are so beset and bewildered by each
little detail of life that they cannot see any relation
among things as a whole, cannot “see the
wood for the trees.”
Or, it may be that a lack of poise, a false estimate
of the relations of things, makes them find
“their own affairs” so interesting or exhausting
that the observing mind gets no large or
deep impressions to be added to the sum of the
knowledge the inner self possesses.</p>

<p>For either of these classes the wakeful night
may prove more restful and helpful than hours
of sleep. It may be made to bring a breadth
of view that will lift one out of the narrow
limits in which daily life is passed. It may
do as much as this for any of us, and, if we
reject the receptive mood, and insist upon objecting
to the wakefulness, we may thereby deprive
ourselves of some of the most illuminating
experiences.</p>

<p>Someone has said: “Sleep, like drink, may
drown our sorrows, yet it also drowns our joys.
What could we not accomplish if we did not
require sleep?”
It may be comforting to think of this when
we are lying awake, that at least we are wasting
no time. The gift of wakefulness is often as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>57</span>
desirable as is the gift of sleep, and, if we welcome
the one as what must be—with as much
cheerfulness as the other—each will bring us
equal blessings. It often happens that what we
regard as evil is but Life’s left hand outstretched
with a gift whose use we did not recognize
when presented by her right hand.</p>

<small>THE PURPOSE OF SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">Sleep is a life giver as well as a life saver.<br />

<span class="smcap">Willard Moyer.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">But</span>  none of these things lessens the benefits
of real sleep, nor are they intended to show
that sleep is unnecessary, for although it may
be true, as Dr. Charles Brodie Patterson says
in “The New Heaven and the New Earth,” that man will some day get along without sleep,
no one is yet able to do that.</p>

<p>Although our troubles make us lose sleep, we
could lose all or nearly all our troubles if we
got natural sleep. Forgetfulness of daily frets,
of the wear and tear of contact with the sharp
edges of our own temper and the temper of
others—these are the things that sleep blots
out. “Go to sleep,” says Mother Nature,
“and forget your troubles.” And to blot them
out even for a time means surcease of sorrow
and worry for that time at least, and a new way
of looking at them when we have awakened.
That is what sleep is for. It is the use of it.</p>

<p>Pat took Mike to church for the first time,
and, when the ceremony was over, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>59</span>
“Well, Mike, what do you think uv it?”
“Think uv it, Pat? The candles, the bowings,
the incinse, and the garmints,—it do bate
the divil.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Pat, “thot’s the intintion.”
And so it is the intention of sleep to “beat
the devil” of unrest and dissatisfaction. Nothing
makes us feel better than a good night’s
sleep. It soothes the aching muscles, quiets the
jangling nerves, brushes away the cobwebs of
the mind, and leaves us rested and refreshed,
strong to meet the events of the new day.</p>

<p>It is after a bad night that we rise oppressed
with fear for what the day may bring
us; overwhelmed in advance with shadowings
of evil. This, in itself, makes us unequal to
the demands of the day. If any seeming strain
is put upon us that day, we are apt to make errors
in meeting it; if we find anyone has failed
to do just what seemed to us best, we upbraid
him roundly and unlovingly, making him and
ourselves unhappy.</p>

<p>At the close of such a spoiled day, when we
review its happenings, we say: “I knew this
morning that this would be an unlucky day. I
felt it as soon as I got up.” But we may not
realize that that very attitude of fear and apprehension
may have caused all that we call
ill-luck. Remember this, then, lest the one bad
day should spoil another night.</p>

<p>Often after a night of sound, wholesome, re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>60</span>freshing
sleep we are surprised to find that
what looked like a mountain at midnight is
now scarcely a hillock. We find that we can
see around it on all sides, and the prospect of
surmounting that difficulty fills us with peculiar
delight. We are no longer apprehensive of
anything. The things we see in our work in
the world are no more terrible than what we
see in that unknown world which we enter
nightly through the gate of sleep. We long
to pass that gate, yet we know nothing of where
we go, how far we travel, or by what means
we come back.</p>

<p>If we can trust Life for what the night
brings, we can trust it further and gladly accept
what the day brings. We feel this, even if
we are not conscious of it, and after a good
sleep (this is what sleep is for), we accept
it much as the child accepts his mother’s care.</p>

<p>A little boy was riding in a trolley car with
his parents and persisted in standing up, to the
terror of his mother, who begged him to sit
down lest he get hurt.</p>

<p>Turning to his father he whispered, as he
reluctantly took his seat, “What a ’fraid-cat
mother is.”
“Oh, well!” replied his father, “she is
nervous, but you know she has to take care of
her little boy.”
“Yes,” said the child, “that’s what she is
for.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>61</span>
So that is what sleep is for—to take care of
us, but we cannot compel sleep; and the advantage
of recognizing the possible gifts of
wakefulness is that we thus get around to the
frame of mind where we drop into natural
sleep. Impatience not only delays the coming
of sleep, but it robs us of any benefit we might
receive from lying peacefully in the dark.</p>

<small>THE SLEEP OF THE INVALID</small></h2></div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span>  should not think that, because we are
ill, it is natural that we should not sleep.
The invalid needs more and better sleep than
the robust person—and the invalid can have it.</p>

<p>It is true that, as more and better sleep
comes, the invalid will cease to be an invalid—at
least that is the beginning of the end of invalidism.
For Nature provides sleep as the
“balm of hurt minds”—a cure for body or
mind that needs restoring.</p>

<p>In the case of severe illness the physician in
charge feels relieved when he learns that his
patient is sleeping well. The professional idea
of sleep is that nutrition goes on most perfectly
during sleeping hours; that is, that Nature
repairs all the waste that results from the
use of brain and muscle during our waking
hours. The more prolonged and undisturbed
the sleep is, the more opportunity Nature has
to make good the extra demands made upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>63</span>
system by disease. It opens the way for the
“Vis Medicatrix Naturæ”—the healing power
of Life.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the fever patient. Anyone
who has watched beside a loved one slowly
consuming, with the fever raging in his
blood, will remember the sigh of relief that
has gone up from physician and nurse when
the patient falls into a natural sleep after the
turn of things. During dreadful nights and
anxious days we wait breathlessly for the
“crisis”;  we hang upon the physician’s word,
scan his face for every fleeting expression, because
we may be deceived by the disease, but
his practiced eye should know. But we do not
need his assurance when the moaning and restlessness
pass, when the stertorous breathing
quiets, when the skin becomes moist, and the
gentle, regular breathing tells us that natural
sleep has come. If we can be spared, we go
out under the stars and, whether Christian or
pagan, up from the depths of our souls wells
a prayer of thankfulness to “whatever gods
there be” for the incomparable blessing of
sleep. We feel as if we could “go softly all
our days” before the powers who have decreed
that sleep shall gently steep the eyelids of the
one we love.</p>

<p>Nourishment, in the form of food, is desirable,
but more important still is the sleep when
Nature busies herself building new tissue and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>64</span>
blood to make good the ravages of fever’s
siege. We are careful to keep even good news
from the patient, if we have cause to fear that
it will prove too stimulating, and everything
depressing or alarming is absolutely withheld,
because sleep is the paramount need of the depleted
body.</p>

<p>We all recognize the value of sleep to the
person just past the crisis of a severe illness,
and the next thing to learn is that to the person
invalided through some less active cause,
it is as necessary, and that it may be had.</p>

<p>It may seem an extravagant statement to
say that the invalid should be able to summon
sleep at will even better than an active, healthy
person. But we may see the truth of this
statement if we accept Dr. Edward Binns’ assurance
that “in no sense can fatigue be said
to be the cause of sleep,” so that the usual
claim that the sick do not get an opportunity
to weary themselves, and so cannot expect
sound sleep, cannot be accounted a reason for
sleeplessness of the invalid.</p>

<p>To be sure, lying abed is not always restful.
A friend of mine was kept in bed for some
weeks by a broken ankle. It was necessary to
remain in the one position day and night, which
so wore upon her nervous organization that
she grew restless and “lost” much sleep. In
this condition, she said the hardest thing to
bear was the well-meant congratulations of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>65</span>
friends that at least she was “getting a much-needed
rest.”
But the real reason why an invalid should
learn to sleep at will is because sleep alone can
do what Macbeth asks of the physician:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raze out the written troubles of the brain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with some sweet oblivious antidote</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which weighs upon the heart?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, sleep can do this; and illness has need
of just such comfort. The enforced idleness
leads to much reflection and the nervous system
is then ill-adapted to endure emotional strain.
If pain be added there is still greater need for
sleep. Nor is pain absolutely hostile to sleep:
the writer can often go to sleep while the dentist
is drilling and filling his teeth, and Dr. J.
Howard Reed says that this is not very uncommon.</p>

<p>Pain is Nature’s strong protest against overstimulation
or overexertion and the exhaustion
which it occasions is itself conducive to sleep.
It would be better for us to heed that protest
and use our intelligence to secure sound, refreshing
sleep, that Nature might perfect her
cures.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span>  we are kept awake by pain.
Some persons suffer pain that has no remission,
except the temporary deadness that
comes from nervous exhaustion—and sleep.</p>

<p>But sometimes the hardest torture is the
thought that the pain is unnecessary or useless.
I went once to visit a friend, whom I found suffering
from the worst abscesses on the back of
the neck that I ever saw, so frightful that the
sight of them made me, who am a strong man,
feel faint. I asked sympathetically what was
the matter. “Oh,” he said, “I’m getting some
experience.” That consciousness that such pain
was useful helped to make the agony less unendurable.
In fact, though he did not see it all
then, he was getting just what he and those
about him needed. He was a vigorous man,
who took to rural work in a place where the
food was excellent; he was naturally gluttonous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>67</span>
and overate, hence the boils. This he learned;
and also how to bear pain.</p>

<p>There are ways of bearing pain more easily.
We must consider the pain philosophically, and
treat it from all three sides—the bodily, the intellectual,
and the spiritual.</p>

<p>However advanced we may be, it is foolish to
deny that, in common with the rest of mankind,
we are more or less in what Paul called the
bonds of the flesh. To try to treat an aching
tooth without physical means is like trying to
grow a new leg instead of getting an artificial
one. There was a stage in man’s Pre-Adamite
progress from the amœba when, like the crab,
he could grow new legs. Possibly, by discarding
all other faculties, men might again be able
to grow new legs: but it would not pay.</p>

<p>A man who makes hammers may at one time
have made his own files, had a shop for that.
But, as trades became specialized, he found it
better and cheaper to buy his files. Perhaps
the supply is suddenly cut off. Now he could
reassemble from the scrap-heap the file machinery
and make files again, but it would be
at the cost of putting so much time and energy
into that branch as to paralyze the hammer
factory.</p>

<p>So, Nature found that men rarely lost their
legs and that it was more economical to divert
the organization and the energy that reproduced
legs into the brain, which enables men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>68</span>
to supply themselves and their fellows, when
occasion arises, with artificial legs. Accordingly
we have lost much of the power of automatic
self-healing and have gained much power
of deliberate self-healing.</p>

<p>While distrusting crutches and drugs, therefore,
because we see the immediate effect of
them, but cannot know the remote effects of
them, we cannot refuse a hot-water bottle or an
anæsthetic when the pain, the symptom of the
disorder, becomes dangerous in itself. The
fever of typhoid represents a battle within which
must be fought out to a conclusion—successful
or not. But, when the patient is in danger of
dying from the high temperature, it is no inconsistency
for a mental or spiritual healer to cool
the room or sponge the patient with alcohol.</p>

<p>Before we resort to the dentist for the aching
tooth, we may reduce the inflammation by abstaining
from food and starving the blood corpuscles,
which hasten to the diseased part, until,
perhaps, they feed upon the weaker and obnoxious
tissues. This abstinence will go far toward
removing the restlessness that is so torturing
an accompaniment of the pain. These are the
physical remedies.</p>

<p>The mental ones consist mainly in trying to
isolate the aching member, to realize that it is
the tooth, not you, that aches, and to watch it
as if it were a separate person. A little boy
was asked how he felt after a feast of green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>69</span>
apples. “I have a pain in the middle of my
stomach,” he said, “but the rest of me feels
fine.” A further mental remedy is to send to
that separated part, the nerve, the assurance
that you have already its message, which is that
there is inflammation in the tooth and that you
will attend to it as speedily as possible. The
nerve gets tired, as it were, of repeating a message
that gets no attention just as it gets tired
of reporting the ticking of a clock so that we
become unconscious of it; although, if we suspected
that it was the knocking of a burglar’s
tool, we should be kept awake by it night after
night.</p>

<p>And we must not complain. The Japanese
think it rude to complain. If you are miserable,
why make others miserable, too? Better
not even let it be known, if you can help it
without creating unpleasantness, that you suffer.
To solicit sympathy is weakening and the
constant inquiry, “How are you now?” concentrates
your attention on yourself and on
your feelings. If we complained to everyone
of the ticking clock, we would never forget it; it
would become less and less endurable.</p>

<p>The spiritual treatment is harder to make
clear. It is the unwillingness to have pain that
makes it hard to bear. To illustrate again
from the dentist, because that experience is
still common to nearly everyone: We go to
the operating chair, not gladly, but willingly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>70</span>
believing that it is wise and necessary and we
bear the pain without complaining, knowing
that it is the common lot of man. But suppose
you were seized, strapped into the chair, and
then your teeth were drilled and sawed to no
good purpose, how much more frightful would
be the pain. That would be because you believed
it to be unnecessary and useless. It
would be quite different if you trusted the
operator. We must realize, then, that, if there
is a controlling and benevolent Power in the
Universe, which we all, rightly or wrongly, believe
in our hearts, we never can have any pain
that is useless or needless to ourselves, or to
others, our other selves.</p>

<p>We may not see it at the time, but, if we
look for it, we usually shall see it. While writing
this the author was attacked with a violent
toothache: he had exercised ordinary prudence
in attending to his teeth, so that it did not
seem as if the pain were needed to teach care.
But when the toothache came he remembered
that, seldom having pain himself, that subject
had been overlooked among the many chapters
of the book. That was a reason; but, notwithstanding
the efforts of an excellent dentist, the
torture continued. Why?</p>

<p>Why, that he might try these things; and he
did practice them so as to lose no sleep. In
addition he concluded that it was needful just
then that he should feel just such pain in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>71</span>
to revive his sympathy and patience with those
whose harassed nerves account for so much of
their unreasonableness.</p>

<p>With that sense, that one is in a manner suffering
for men, comes something of the exaltation
of the martyr, even with prosaic toothache.
With that certainly disappears all impatience
with the pain.</p>

<p>Perhaps he will be accounted superstitious in
adding that, when these lessons were learned,
the dentist found the trouble and the pain
melted away. But he has had exactly similar
experiences before: a new lesson or a renewal
of it was needed. When the pain was no
longer necessary it ceased. Why should it
continue?</p>

<small>OPIATES</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span>  of the most common signs of something
at fault either with the body or the mind is
headache. Now headache, like wakefulness or
nervousness, so often associated with headache,
is an effect of some error, not a cause of it, and
the wise sufferer will seek the cause even before
he treats the effect.</p>

<p>We call ourselves the most enlightened nation
of the earth to-day, and it is true that a
little knowledge has been more generally diffused
among our people than among other
peoples of the world. But we should not forget
that “a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing”  largely because a little knowledge frequently
proves to be no real knowledge at all.
For example, the “little knowledge” generally
possessed in regard to opiates.</p>

<p>Coal-tar was once a waste product, but toward
the end of the last century a German
chemist discovered that from it could be derived
a drug, acetanilid, which would greatly
lower temperature in fever. This discovery was
hailed as a boon to humanity, and many other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>74</span>
by-products of coal-tar were soon placed on the
market, and regarded as of equal value with
acetanilid. Physicians used them for a time
without questioning, and the people took to
them gladly. Wherever there was a persistent
headache, some one of the coal-tar products was
used, and “headache powders” multiplied.</p>

<p>But a little further knowledge led physicians
to question the expediency of using acetanilid,
phenacetin, antipyrin, or any of the coal-tar
preparations in other than exceptional cases.
Heart-failure and other dangerous results so
frequently followed their use that the wisdom of
using them at all became doubtful. As our
knowledge increases, we are likely to find
both the wisdom and necessity entirely disappearing.</p>

<p>In the meantime, those who have heard that
temporary relief from pain may be had by
using these drugs will go on using them, often
in patent medicines, ignorant of what these nostrums
contain, and the number of deaths resulting
from their use continues to increase. The
only way to protect such people from the result
of their little knowledge, which is really
ignorance, is by making it illegal to sell these
drugs, except by prescription from a physician,
who, in turn, should be held responsible for results.</p>

<p>This is, of course, an interference with the
individual’s right to do as seemeth best to him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>75</span>
and to get his experience in his own way. Herbert
Spencer says, “The ultimate result of
shielding men from the effects of folly is to
fill the world with fools.” But it is the same
sort of interference that makes us hold a man
by main force from throwing himself on the
track before an approaching train, and not the
sort that would forcibly put an overcoat on
him when he did not care to wear it. One may
be no more justifiable than the other, but it
seems more excusable.</p>

<p>All sleeping doses are to be viewed with distrust;
most of them contain opium or morphine,
some still more deadly drugs: Nature
“sets up a tolerance” for them so that, to
obtain the effect, the dose must be increased,
until, if the sufferer does not retreat in time, an
almost incurable drug habit is formed, often
more terrible than the liquor habit, which it
sometimes supplants. Nor do they bring true
sleep.</p>

<p>R. Clarke Newton, in his treatise on “Opium
and Alcohol,” says “Sleeplessness means not
merely unrest, but starvation of the cerebrum.
The only cause for regret in these cases is that
the blunder should ever be committed of supposing
that a stupefying drug which throws the
brain into a condition that mimics and burlesques
sleep can do good. It is deceptive to
give narcotics in a case of this type. The
stupor simply masks the danger. Better far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>76</span>
let the sleepless patient exhaust himself than
stupefy him. Chloral, bromides, and the rest of
the poisons that produce a semblance of sleep
are so many snares in such cases. Sleeplessness
is a malady of the most formidable character,
but it is not to be treated by intoxicating
the organ upon which the stress of the trouble
falls.”
The late Dr. Alonzo Clark, who for years
stood at the head of his profession as a consulting
physician in New York City, is quoted as
saying, “All curative agents, so called, are
poisons, and, as a consequence, every dose diminishes
the patient’s vitality.” I doubt
whether this view of drugs would be seriously
contested by any of his professional brethren
of good standing.</p>

<p>The venerable Professor Joseph M. Smith,
M.D., said: “All medicines which enter the
circulation poison the blood in the same manner
as do the poisons that produce the disease.
Drugs do not cure disease.”
John Bigelow, in the “Mystery of Sleep” (p. 190), adds: “With drug-poisons should be
classed nearly, if not quite, all fermented drinks—the
most costly part of some people’s diet
who indulge in them at all—coffee, tea, tobacco,
spices, and most of the constantly multiplying
tonics and condiments of the table. All of them
have a tendency, directly or indirectly, to discourage
or impair sleep, and, as such, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>77</span>
‘hostes humani generis’ (enemies of the human
race). Their interference with sleep,
though perhaps the most serious, is very far
from being their only pathogenetic influence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bigelow then cites from Jahr’s “Manual
of Medicine” the fearful disturbances of sleep
caused by fifteen drugs, all taken as samples
from the list in their order under the single
letter “A.”
Contrary to the general belief, sleeplessness
is more often a consequence of insanity than a
cause of it. (See Appendix A.)</p>

<small>DEVICES FOR GOING TO SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Southey, in “The Doctor,” thus summarizes some of the
chief devices to attain sleep by monotony: “I listened to the
river and to the ticking of my watch; I thought of all sleepy
sounds and of all soporific things—the flow of water, the
humming of bees, the motion of a boat, the waving of a field
of corn, the nodding of a mandarin’s head on the chimney-piece,
a horse in a mill, the opera, Mr. Humdrum’s conversations,
Mr. Proser’s poems, Mr. Laxative’s speeches, Mr.
Lengthy’s sermons. I tried the device of my own childhood,
and fancied that the bed rushed with me round and round. At
length Morpheus reminded me of Dr. Torpedo’s Divinity Lectures,
where the voice, the manner, the matter, even the very
atmosphere and the streaming candle-light, were all alike
soporific; when he who, by strong effort, lifted up his head and
forced open the reluctant eyes, never failed to see all around
him asleep. Lettuces, cowslip wine, poppy syrup, mandragora,
hop pillows, spider’s web pills, and the whole tribe of narcotics
would have failed—but this was irresistible; and thus twenty
years after date, I found benefit from having attended the
course.”</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Frequent</span> impressions on the mind, or
calls on the attention, tend to make us
sleepy; thus looking at pictures, the attempt
to study, driving in a carriage. In extreme
cases this is very marked. A boy named Caspar
Hauser was shut up alone in a gloomy little
room until he was about eighteen years old;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>79</span>
then he was brought to Nürnberg and abandoned
in the street; this was in 1828. He was
to all intents a baby and could not walk, nor
speak, nor see clearly, as he had never known
any of the common objects of life—men or animals
or plants, or the moon or sun or even the
sky.</p>

<p>He would go to sleep instantly on being taken
outside the house, because the number of new
sensations instantly tired his consciousness.</p>

<p>For the same reason that the consciousness
is quickly exhausted, many old or delicate persons
readily fall asleep. Marie de Manacéïne
says that Moivre, the French mathematician,
used to sleep twenty hours a day during his old
age, leaving only four for science and the other
occupations of life.</p>

<p>Monotony naturally fatigues consciousness
and is often successfully used to produce sleep;
the regular dropping of water, the sound of
a brook will put those to sleep whom it does
not make nervous. Lullabies and slumber songs
and dull lectures all come under the same
head of devices to tire the consciousness.</p>

<p>Narcotic drugs do not weary consciousness;
they simply destroy it. They stupefy us instead
of inducing sleep. Those who would wisely
learn about this by experiments upon others
rather than upon themselves, will find it all in
the article by Ringer and Sainsbury on “Sedatives” in Tuke’s “Dictionary of Psychological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>80</span>
Medicine.” It is enough for us to be assured
that narcotic sleep is less like real sleep than
the hibernation of the animal is like repose.
(But see “Remedies” in Appendix A.)</p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher used to get up when he
was sleepless and take a cold bath, a good device
for a full-blooded, vigorous person: but a weak
person would not “react” and get warm again.
For such an one it would be better to sponge off
and restore the circulation by rubbing. Some
physicians have prescribed, with good success,
blood-warm baths, beginning at a temperature
of about 98 and heated up to 110 or 115 Fahrenheit.
When the moisture has been absorbed by
wrapping one’s self in a blanket, throw it off
and get quickly into a warm bed. Mark Twain
used to get to sleep by lying down on the bathroom
floor after the bath.</p>

<p>Some, when other means fail, find it effective
to place a cold-water bag at the back of the
neck, or to rub the feet with a rough towel: with
others, a hot-water bottle at the back of the
neck works better. A warm footbath helps
some persons. At the sanitariums they sponge
with warm water, rub with wet salt, gently
sponge it off, and dry the body—all of which
helps the blood to the surface. It is always
well to see that the bowels are emptied. Only
trial and judgment will show whether any of
these will effect a cure: they all aim at the same
mark, to abstract the blood from the brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>81</span></p>

<p>That drinking milk produces sleep in some
persons may probably be due to the lactic acid
in the milk, which is a soporific like morphine.
Perhaps its use is to help young animals to the
long sleeps they need.</p>

<p>Willard Moyer, in an entertaining essay,
tells us that it is often advisable for the stomach
to have sufficient work for the blood to do
so as to call it from the brain. This does not
mean that a meal that will overload the stomach
is a cure for insomnia, but that something
light, such as a cup of warm milk and a cracker,
may often “send one comfortably to sleep like
a drowsy kitten or a well-fed baby.”
A. Fleming, following Durham, the author of
the “Psychology of Sleep,” showed that to
deprive the brain of blood by pressing the
carotid arteries for thirty seconds brought immediate
and deep sleep, but it only continued
while all pulsation of these arteries is stopped.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It has been found by cruel experiments on
young puppies that sleep is more necessary to
them than food, as they die after being kept
awake four or five days, but may live ten or
fifteen days without food. They easily go to
sleep when their heads are level with their
bodies, and they will not go to sleep with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>82</span>
heads lower than their bodies: of course, the
raised head drains some blood out of the brain.</p>

<p>This is the reason that heat or extreme cold,
both of which bring the blood to the surface
and drain it away from the brain, will often
produce sleep. That is why the cowboy likes
to sleep with his feet to the fire. On the other
hand, the demand on the heart of cold hands
or feet for more blood to keep them warm
may make the heart pump so strongly that it
sends more blood to the brain and keeps one
awake. So also joy, anger, or anxiety cause
a flow of blood to the brain and hinder sleep.</p>

<p>Becker and Schuller have treated insomnia
by wrapping the entire body in wet sheets and
also by applying cold compresses to the head.
This last device is used by students, with doubtful
success, “to keep the brain cool”;  it is
sometimes affected because it looks like working
hard. Sometimes an ice cap, a double rubber
cap filled with cold water, will bring sleep.</p>

<p>The Russian nobles used to make servants
scratch their heels for a long time; our ladies
have their hair brushed; and A. H. Savage-Landor
says that Corean mothers put their
babies to sleep by scratching them gently on
the stomach. I have tried this rubbing, rather
than scratching, with great success. Spanish
women rub the children’s upper spine to put
them to sleep. Light exercise before lying
down is often a good expedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>83</span></p>

<p>Sometimes a pillow of heated hops or of balsam
pine needles will induce sleep. To change
the hour of going to bed occasionally, yielding
to apparently untimely drowsiness, often helps,
as it accustoms us to gain sleep at irregular
times.</p>

<p>To “relax,” to let the muscles become perfectly
loose, is an art, though it should be
natural to one going to sleep. Mrs. Richard
Hovey recommends shaking the fingers, letting
them hang loose like a bunch of strings of
beads, and extending the movement to the
wrist, arms, feet, and legs. This is the best
form of calisthenic exercise for sleeplessness.
It aids us in getting limp so as to lie at ease.</p>

<small>MORE DEVICES FOR GOING TO SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span>  life be a succession of ideas, says Dr.
Binns, then sleep is the interval; “consequently,
we may say that sleep is the art of
escaping reflection.” If one could follow the
Chinese advice, divest the mind of all unpleasant
images, “the secret of sleep at will,” Dr.
Binns thinks, “would be in the possession of
all men.”
This accords in its essence with the very
modern theory of Dr. Henry Hubbard Foster
of Cornell University, that sleep results from
the absence of stimulations. It is conceivable
that things that stimulate, or rouse us, may
come from inside as well as from outside. A
sudden thought, a new, delightful, or horrible
mental picture will arouse us and send sleep
flying as effectually as a sudden noise or an
exciting commotion from without.</p>

<p>We might amend the Chinese advice thus:
put out of the mind all images, pleasant or un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>85</span>pleasant,
or, as Dr. Gardner puts it, “bring
the mind to a single sensation.” It has long
been known that monotony will induce sleep.
Not merely the monotony of silence, but sometimes
even the monotony of great noise, such as
the ceaseless firing of heavy guns which have
lulled the wearied soldiers into rest. There is
a sleepy sound in “The distant boom of a random
gun which the foe was sullenly firing.” It
is the sudden, irregular noise which disturbs.
If anyone listens for several hours to soft,
flowing music, he will have great difficulty in
keeping awake, no matter how great a lover
of music he may be, particularly if he has to
sit in the same position all the time. Let a
musical number with strongly marked staccato
movement be introduced, let the drum throb
loud at intervals, the horns blare, then the
sleeper will awake and find renewed enjoyment,
not because he loves noise, but because the monotony
has been broken. The mind has responded
to the new stimulus.</p>

<p>Professor Boris Sidis, of the Harvard Physiological
Laboratory, says that “the fundamental
conditions of sleep are monotony and
limitation of voluntary movements. Sleep,” adds Sidis, is not so much due to cutting off
impressions through the senses, be they intense
or faint, as to the monotony of the “impressions
that reduced the organism to the passive
state which we experience in sleep.” In other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>86</span>
words, monotony has such a benumbing, deadening
effect upon the mind that sleep naturally
ensues.</p>

<p>Although Binns did not know Foster’s and
Sidis’ modern views, yet accepting Gardner’s
theory of “bringing the mind to a single sensation,” he worked out a plan for inducing
sleep which he said nearly always succeeded.
During his long practice he had known of only
two instances where it failed when faithfully
and intelligently tried.</p>

<p>The method is simple, yet it includes putting
out of the mind all images pleasant or unpleasant,
and restricting voluntary movements. It
is this: “Turn on the right side, place the head
comfortably on the pillow, let the head fall naturally,
using the pillow only to support the
neck, slightly close the lips,—though this is
not absolutely essential,—take full inspiration
through the nostrils, drawing in as much air
as possible, then leave the lungs to their own
action, neither hastening nor checking exhalation.
Think of the breath as passing from the
nostrils in one continuous stream, and, the very
instant the person so conceives, consciousness
and memory depart, the muscles relax, the
breath comes regularly, he no longer wakes but
sleeps. It is all the effort of but a moment.”</p>

<p>Another method in common use is counting
up to a hundred on an imaginary string of
beads. Often one will have lost consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>87</span>
before the hundredth bead is reached, but
sometimes they have to be counted over and
over, and sometimes the plan fails altogether.
The immediate reason for this is undoubtedly
that we have not brought the mind to a single
sensation, nor succeeded in cutting off the impressions
that come through the senses.</p>

<p>Everybody has at some time used some such
device for inducing sleep to visit him. The
practice of imagining sheep jumping over a
gate and counting them as they go is but another
way of bringing the mind to a single sensation,
of deliberately securing monotony and
shutting out all stimuli, as scientific men call
the various causes that arouse sensation in us.
Such simple devices are never harmful, and are
so frequently followed by sleep that they continue
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>If the impressions received through the channels
of sense cannot or will not be shut off,
it is useless to continue counting beads or
sheep, or seeing a stream of breath. It becomes
necessary to discover what it is that is back of
the stimulation—what impression is so vivid
and so insistent that it will not down. As Frederick
Palmer says in his delightful book, “The
Vagabond,” we should “take a good look at a
thing before we run away from it.”</p>

<small>STILL FURTHER DEVICES</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">The sleep of a laboring man is sweet.<br />

<span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">“T<span class="smcap">he</span> Witchery of Sleep” records for us
some interesting mechanical devices for
inducing sleep, more common in Europe than
in this country. Their inventors hope to perfect
them so that they may take the place of
drugs and “sleeping potions.” This is an end
devoutly to be wished by all who know the
steady increase of the “drug habit.”
Among these sleep-inducing instruments the
newest is the “vibrating coronet.” This coronet
has three metal bands which encircle the
head and two strips extending to the eyelids.
By means of a spring these strips vibrate the
eyelid gently and induce drowsiness. All the
mechanical devices are constructed on the plan
of inducing eye-weariness, whether by vibration
or by fixity. Either effect is in accordance with
the modern theories of sleep. Sleep may be induced
by monotony also of sounds; by concentration
either of the attention or the hearing on
one point, or by more numerous impressions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>89</span>
than the eye can comfortably receive; thus,
when riding in a train, the succession of views
will often induce sleepiness.</p>

<p>The “Alouette,” a collection of little mirrors
attached to the ebony panels of a box, is so
placed that a ray of light falls on the mirrors in
such a way as to fatigue the eye of the beholder.
Both this and the “Fascinator,” a
highly polished nickel ball attached to a flexible
wire depending from a metal band similar to
the “Coronet,” work on the plan of concentrating
the vision. In a similar way a light-house
or a miniature flashlight, with its appearing
and disappearing light, induces drowsiness,
possibly hypnotic, through incessant change.
It is needless to say that these devices might be
injurious to the sight and certainly would not
work where the cause of sleeplessness is eyestrain.
That is a case for the oculist.</p>

<p>But when it is impossible to obtain mechanical
devices, there are many simple schemes
of inducing sleep. Any light work, mental or
physical, is helpful. To start writing letters,
particularly if one is not fond of letter-writing,
will sometimes induce sleepiness very quickly.
Sorting and arranging old papers will have the
same effect, unless one is of a nature to find
such an occupation exciting.</p>

<p>Of course, a drawback in any of these light
occupations is that by the time one has undressed
drowsiness may have fled. That possi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>90</span>bility
makes it desirable that all preparations
for bed shall first be made and a warm robe
with comfortable bedroom shoes shall constitute
the only extra clothing. Warmth of body,
especially of the feet, is essential to sleep.
Sometimes so simple a thing as a hot-water bottle
at the feet, or even woolen bed-socks, will
make all the difference between wakefulness
and refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>Then there is the matter of deep breathing,
which seems especially adapted to feeble or
run-down physiques. That is a large subject
more familiar to the people of the Orient than
to us. Some Orientals are able to put themselves
into trance-like sleep by their knowledge
of deep breathing. Numerous books have been
written treating of this subject, among the
best of which are “The Science of Breath,” by
Ramacharaka, and “The Law of Rhythmical
Breath,” by Ella A. Fletcher, though the
“Rhythmical Breath” seems fanciful to
Western readers.</p>

<p>Sleeplessness is sometimes due to lack of
physical exercise, and, when that is so, no device
is so effective as work—real physical effort.
A great many persons take calisthenic
exercises and go in for physical culture to develop
muscles and also to regulate circulation
so that sleep will come more readily. These
are good makeshifts for persons who have no
opportunity to work, but, where circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>91</span>
make actual labor possible, no substitute can
satisfactorily take its place. Gardening, shoveling
snow, sawing or chopping wood, all give a
variety of motion and a zest of exertion superior
to any gymnastics. Even a small amount
of some such labor daily will often work a complete
cure for insomnia.</p>

<p>Everybody knows of some plan or device for
inducing sleep, and all of them are more or
less successful—sometimes. Indeed, this is
so true that it leads to the belief that, after
all, the expectation of sleep helps to bring
it, and here suggestion and auto-suggestion
come in.</p>

<p>Of late, a number of persons have tried the
starvation cure—fasting for several days. This
is frequently successful with robust, hearty
people, who may unconsciously be eating too
much or eating too stimulating food. Many
who feel unequal to a complete fast might cut
down the amount of food as much as one-half,
with happy results. A vegetarian diet undoubtedly
helps, too, although among the lower
animals carnivora sleep more than herbivora.
The success of vegetarianism, both in insomnia
and other diseases, may well be due to the diminished
temptation to overeat and the less
concentrated diet.</p>

<p>In any event, it is well for the sufferer from
sleeplessness to study his own case and experiment
with any or all the known devices to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>92</span>
whether, by this means or that, he can lure sleep
to his pillow again.</p>

<p>And, speaking of pillows, it is well to remember
that one pillow is better than two, and
that the one should not be too high, too hard,
too soft, or too warm, and that it should be
thoroughly aired every day. It should be odorless
and cool and have the cover changed frequently.
Clean bed linen is in itself an effective
device for inducing sleep, just as perfect
ventilation adds an hundredfold to the refreshment
we get from our slumbers.</p>

<p>The best way to learn to sleep is to practice
putting others to sleep. Thy gifts will be unto
thyself when thy benefits are to another.</p>

<p>We never know anything thoroughly till we
try to teach it. All these plans and devices may
be suggested one by one to any sleepless person.
Select what you think most suitable and
most likely to be accepted, and let the suggestion
be that this is a good plan or something
just called to your attention that seems sensible.
If you do not succeed in one or two, it is difficult
to secure trial of more at that time.</p>

<p>Every temperament is different and may respond
to different methods: for instance, a
ticking clock or dropping water, which make
some persons drowsy, will make others inexpressibly
nervous.</p>

<p>The trained nurse will tell you that, when you
are trying to get the patient to sleep, whisper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>93</span>ing
must not be allowed: the sibilant sound is
irritating and the patient unconsciously strains
to catch what is said. Speak in a quiet, even,
ordinary tone. Do not fuss, putting the shade
a little higher and lower, stealing across the
room, and so on. If anything is to be done, to
walk quietly and naturally will disturb the
sleeper much less than tiptoeing about.</p>

<p>That mysterious thing that we call “personality” has much to do with the power to
bring sleep to others. Some persons can put
almost anyone to sleep by quietly holding the
hand, but nearly everyone has some of this
power. Some persons, especially children, are
readily got to sleep by lying down beside them.</p>

<p>Reading aloud slowly and in a uniform voice
will bring sleep to most persons. When
drowsiness comes, the voice may be lowered a
little and continued until slumber closes the
eyes. (Concerning the varieties and causes of
Insomnia, see also Appendix A.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>  nature of hypnotic sleep has not yet
been fully determined, which is not wonderful
when we remember our ignorance of
natural sleep. We may call the active hypnotic
state a condition of excessive attention to the
main idea presented and complete oblivion to
other ideas. But this state is preceded by a
passive condition resembling sleep. The use
and value of hypnotic sleep is now occupying
the attention of scientific men and it bids fair to
be an important curative agent. Where once
the patient suffering from insomnia was treated
by drugs, he is now more successfully treated
through suggestion. The change is a most desirable
one and in line with that newer thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>95</span>
which recognizes the power of regeneration
within the soul of the individual. For, the main
things in the development of hypnosis and suggestion
as curative agents is the recognition
that an appeal can be made to the subconscious
mind, which, as Dr. Worcester says, “is more
sensitive to good and evil than our conscious
mind.” To appeal to our latent powers to overcome
our own weaknesses or limitations is
greater and better than to combat these weaknesses
through drugs. Many physicians who
formerly employed hypnosis have adopted a
substitute for it, the so-called hypnoidal state,
mere passivity with closed eyes. Hypnotizing
is in many cases needless and dangerous.</p>

<p>Insomnia, like any other trouble not due to
the breakdown of a physical organ, is more a
moral than a material lapse, and can best be
cured by moral means: that is, by the aid of the
will and its associated faculties. Sleeplessness,
nervousness, excitability, and irritability have
their rise in mental and emotional states more
often than in physical states, and, under such
conditions, treatment by drugs is of little real
use. In the disease hysteria, mental trouble
may masquerade as physical defect, for instance
paralysis or even blindness, while the physical
parts concerned are in no wise impaired. The dependence
placed upon merely extraneous things
does not assist in the development of our own
inner powers. Even when drugs seem to relieve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>96</span>
the outward symptoms, they fail to strengthen
the moral nature, so greatly in need of
strength. The man of drugs only is at a disadvantage
as compared with the suggestionist
in treating such disorders. Dr. J. D. Quackenbos
says, “The suggestionist invokes the better
subliminal self—invests it with control, and seldom
fails to effect the desired purpose.” He
further maintains, what all investigators are
now coming to admit, that, when the patient
wakes from hypnotic sleep, during which helpful,
curative suggestions have been made to
him, he is “constrained to obey the impulses
of his own superior self.”
The power of suggestion, whether during
waking or sleeping hours, is only beginning to
be recognized, although its use in one form or
another is centuries old. The thoughtless, as
well as the thoughtful, use it more or less every
hour of the day, while all of us may know
that we are occasionally the victims of auto-suggestion
when we suffer from functional
ailments.</p>

<p>Auto-suggestion is merely the suggestion of
the self to the self, and from ill-advised suggestions
spring nearly all the little impediments
to sleep and health. Such a suggestion to ourselves
as that we need certain favorable conditions
for sleeping will keep us awake when
those conditions are not possible. We say, “I
cannot sleep with a clock ticking in the room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>97</span>
with me,” and so we lie awake and suffer nervous
tortures if we hear a clock tick. Or we
say of something our friends do, or of some
natural habit they have, “That makes me so
nervous I almost fly out of my skin”  thus we
inflict upon ourselves suffering that we need not
endure.</p>

<p>The strong soul will call his “superior
self” to his aid to conquer this tendency. He
will suggest to himself that he is able to sleep
without regard to clocks or other disturbance;
that the peculiarities of other people have no
power to irritate, annoy, or otherwise upset his
nervous system; that even in the midst of
alarums he may have peace, if he so wills, and
can sleep under ordinary conditions without
fear or annoyance.</p>

<p>But, to be able to do this, one must have
faith in himself, in his purpose, in his own desire
to overcome his fears, for, as Dr. Worcester
remarks, “the value of suggestion lies
in its character and in the character of the man
who makes it.” If we say these things to ourselves,
feeling all the time that it is useless,
we are not likely to impress the subconscious
mind or rouse it to activity. Self-deception is
not often beneficial in its effects. No more shall
we make headway if we merely repeat such
suggestions in parrot-fashion. You remember
the story of the old woman who heard that faith
would remove mountains: so she determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>98</span>
to try it on the hill in front of her bedroom
window. All night she repeated to herself
that the mountain would be removed. In the
morning she awoke to see the hill still in front
of her. “There,” she said, “I knew it would
be.”
Anyhow, the faith that removes most mountains
is the faith that gets a shovel. It is essential
that we concentrate our minds upon the
matter in hand, excluding from our thoughts
anything that might distract us and that we fix
our attention upon removing the fault. It is
for this reason that the hypnoidal state, or the
wakeful night or the moment when one is nearly
dropping to sleep is the best time either for
suggestion to a patient or for one to indulge in
helpful auto-suggestion. As objective consciousness
fades, it is easier to impress the
subliminal self-consciousness and invoke its aid.</p>

<p>Those who do not know themselves well
enough to be able to respond to their own suggestion,
may be helped by another in whom they
have faith. If they submit themselves willingly
to suggestion, they may find themselves so
strengthened that they will shortly be able to
control themselves by auto-suggestion. Like
almost all upward tendencies, this power is a
matter of development.</p>

<p>As we come to understand hypnotism better,
we learn that we need not fear ill results from
thus yielding ourselves for a good purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>99</span>
to another,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for one’s subconscious self is always
on watch and will not be compelled to do
that which is contrary to one’s own nature or
habit of thought. Hypnotic sleep differs from
natural sleep in that the hypnotized person
usually preserves a degree of intelligence and
invariably a moral sense which are not conspicuous
in normal sleep and dreaming. Scientific
investigators are quite well agreed on this
point, and Dr. Worcester’s experience has convinced
him of its truth.</p>

<p>So, if all other means of securing sleep
should fail, we may have recourse to this newest
method of curing nervous and other functional
disorders. It is merely one way of getting
into closer touch with the Infinite and
Universal and coming into line with life’s underlying
laws.</p>

<p>The use of auto-suggestion is not limited to
inducing sleep: it may rid us of evil habits,
disturbing thoughts, and all hatred, malice, and
uncharitableness—which in their turn interfere
with sleep.</p>

<small>“PERCHANCE TO DREAM”</small></h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap">“W<span class="smcap">e</span> are such stuff as dreams are made
on,” as Shakespeare says, and yet no
one even to this day knows what that “stuff” may be. We separate man’s life into intellect,
feeling, will; or, like the Hindoos, into seven
phases; we subdivide these, recognizing special
powers and functions belonging to each; we
dissect man’s frame; we dissolve his body
into its component parts, and yet, when all is
done, we know as little about <i class="em">life</i>, the essence
of man, as our father Adam knew. As Omar
says, we hear “much talk about it and about” and yet we get nowhere. It is much the same
with dreams. We need, therefore, only summarize
and review the talk.</p>

<p>Dreams occupied their most important place
in the thought of man at its beginning. His
action has frequently been directed by a dream
and the fate of nations has hinged upon its
interpretation. Even in the present day of
matter-of-fact science, at some time in his life
following the racial bent, almost every human
being has paid some attention to his dreams.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>102</span>
The superstitious—which includes the most of
us—still put faith in their dreams, though they
know not whence they come, nor their relation
to the most mutable of physical conditions.
And this though ages ago Sirach uttered this
warning, “Dreams deceive many and fail those
who build upon them.”
Scientific investigation has made known
many of the causes of dreams and shown us
what slight incidents may determine their direction.
For instance, dreams involving hearing
often take their rise in noises made by the
processes going on in the body. What we eat
and the state of our digestion greatly affect
the character of our dreams.</p>

<p>This has long been recognized by those who
try to decipher special significance in dreams.
Twenty-five centuries ago Pythagoras believed
that the gas-generating beans destroyed the
chance of having enlightening or important
dreams, and so forbade their use. In similar
fashion interpreters of dreams were warned
by Artemidorus to inquire first whether the
dreamer had eaten heartily or lightly before
falling asleep; while Philostratus maintained
that skillful interpreters always refused to expound
dreams following the use of wine.</p>

<p>Thus we see that even in ancient times the
relation between eating and sleeping was recognized.
In more modern days it is recorded that
poets and writers had visions from eating raw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>103</span>
flesh, while Mrs. Radcliffe, author of “The
Mysteries of Udolpho,” is said to have deliberately
induced horrid dream phantoms by supping
late on indigestible food as a means of
getting “printer’s copy.”
De Quincey’s “Confessions” is a monument
to the beauty and the horror of the dreams
from drugs. There is also reason to think that
the terrors of delirium tremens are true
dreams. John B. Gough described from fearful
experience the agony of seeing and feeling
that which is dreadful, mainly because the sufferer
knows that it, nevertheless, does not exist
and could not exist. This can be explained,
in our present state of knowledge, only by the
supposition that the subconscious mind, uncorrected
and unrestrained by the senses, alone is
awake. Boris Sidis shows that we have no
waking remembrance of many of our dreams,
even of most harassing ones.</p>

<p>It is probable that perfect sleep is undisturbed
by dreams, pleasant or otherwise.
Dreams are an evidence of the semi-conscious
condition of some of the senses; the objective
mind is no longer in control, but is passive, and
the subjective mind is active. Yet while
dreaming, the objective mind is not so completely
unconscious (as it would be if wrapped
in profound slumber) but that it gets glimpses
of the workings of the subjective mind, often
very distorted glimpses. This frequently leads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>104</span>
to horrible or impossible situations in dreams.</p>

<p>It is an interesting question how far we are
responsible for our dreams. It is true in
dreams, as in waking, that from the same sensations
individuals will evolve different results,
just as nasturtiums, drawing nourishment from
the same soil, will put forth blossoms of different
color and odor. The factor that changes
these same elements into different results is
something inherent in the individual person or
plant.</p>

<p>So that we are not entirely responsible for
what we dream, yet the mental habits, the real
tone of mind maintained during waking hours,
has its effect upon dreams. They constitute an
index of the mind. So far as sleep is concerned,
of course, “subjective” mind is simply
our remembered experiences, our mental
capital, and can be used in waking hours and
is constantly so used: we get traces of these
in our dreams. Age, sex, and temperament also
affect the nature of dreams.</p>

<p>If then our sleep is disturbed by unpleasant
dreams, it becomes necessary to investigate the
causes. Have we eaten too much or too hurriedly?
Are our innermost thoughts clean and
wholesome, fit for the light of day? Roman
philosophers held that he who wished to obtain
knowledge of the will of any of the gods, must
fast and lie down to sleep beside the shrine of
the god, his thoughts filled with longing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>105</span>
desire for such knowledge. There is more than
mere superstition in that. If we abstain from
all excesses and are filled with desire to know
the will of the gods, dreams, when they come
to us, will not disturb or distress us.</p>

<p>Dreams are admittedly sometimes prophetic,
or have at least an indirect significance touching
events not yet come to pass. Galen tells of
a man who dreamed that his leg had turned to
stone, and a few days later found his leg
paralyzed, perhaps an instance of auto-suggestion.
Gessner died from a malignant growth
which developed in his breast in the exact
spot where, a few nights previously, he had
dreamed that a serpent bit him; while Aristides,
dreaming that he was wounded in the
knee by a bull, awoke to find a tumor there.</p>

<p>These and many better authenticated cases of
dream warnings are not so strange as they
seem at first hearing. They may be explained
largely by the fact that remote and vague sensations
of suffering and disease are able to
make deeper impression upon the mind when
the interests and activities of the waking life
are submerged in sleep.</p>

<p>The duration of dreams is another matter of
great interest. Most persons feel and say
that they “dreamed all night long,” and will
proceed to support their statement by relating
various incidents of their dreams; their prolonged
sensations of pleasure or horror; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>106</span>
events that perhaps covered years. Yet, in
reality, the dream may have occupied less than
a minute. The dreamer cannot measure the
time spent in dreaming, for the unconscious
condition of the objective mind obliterates the
sense of time, space or material limitations.
This accounts for the prodigious feats, the marvels
and impossible achievements of dreams
that seem to the dreamer in no way disproportionate.</p>

<p>What we do know is that some of the most
wonderful dreams have occupied but a few moments,
and so far scientific research seems to
limit them to an hour or two at most. Mohammed’s
dream was completed within the time
occupied by a falling vase; and it is on record
that a man fell asleep just as the clock struck
the first stroke of twelve and awoke in a cold
sweat on the last stroke, having dreamed that
he had spent thirty years in prison, suffering
tortures of mind and body.</p>

<p>All this makes it easy to understand how, to
an infinite mind, a thousand years may be as
one day and one day as a thousand years, and
how, in our degree, the quiet, self-controlled
mind may be unmoved by time.</p>

<p>It is the vivid impression made by such
dreams that makes us feel that they must have
lasted a long time. Then, as George Trumbull
Ladd says, the recital of our dreams is often
colored, unconsciously, “by our self-consciou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>107</span>s
and rational waking life when we bring the
scene before the awakened mind.” In other
words, many sensations that we think we experienced
are heightened by the idea in the objective
mind of what such sensations ought
to be.</p>

<p>It may be that when the time comes that</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">He</span>  who would get the benefit of sleep must
look after health.</p>

<p>Health, after all, is merely that condition
where all parts of the human organism work
together without friction. We think of health
as something that is bestowed upon us from
without; something over which we have no control
and almost no influence. Perhaps this
queer idea is partly responsible for the general
lack of health to-day.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that it is necessary that
human beings endowed with tremendous capacity
for enjoyment, with everything at hand
to enjoy, should be hindered by a mere lack
of that harmony that we call health from fully
enjoying life. It seems only reasonable that
there must be some explanation of lack of
health and some way of escape from it.</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted that most of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>109</span>
diseases to which man thinks himself heir are
due to improper, unnatural living. It could
safely be added that the remainder of our ill-health
and distress comes in large part from
improper, unnatural thinking.</p>

<p>The common man may laugh at the idea that
we make our own ill-health; if you were not
more intelligent than the common man, you
would not read this book, so that you will probably
see at once that your own experience has
taught you the truth of it. You will discover
that you have learned for yourself, albeit for
the most part unconsciously, that what a man
thinks about, that he becomes. So it would seem
that the natural and proper thing to do, if we
find ourselves suffering from sleeplessness and
ill-health, is to look after our way of living and
thinking.</p>

<p>Medical science was once the attempt to cure
disease; as Dr. Woods Hutchinson says, it is
now coming to be the science of preventing
disease, and everything that tends to that end
is properly a part of the science of medicine,
though it have no connection with the myriad
drugs of the pharmacopœia.</p>

<p>Until we compare conditions to-day with
those of even fifty years ago, we can form no
idea of our rapid strides toward natural living.
If we walk the streets of the city or the roads
of suburban towns and villages very early in
the morning, at any season of the year, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>110</span>
find the vast majority of the houses with open
windows. It is true that the opening may not
always be very wide, but they are open. Fifty
years ago all would have been closed.</p>

<p>Within the recollection of those whose memories
go back a quarter of a century, we were
taught that night air was dangerous to breathe
and was to be completely shut out from our
houses. Now we know that the organism needs
fresh air by night as well as by day, and that
the most dangerous thing about night air is
the lack of it.</p>

<p>We now treat the most dreaded diseases,
pneumonia and tuberculosis, almost wholly by
fresh air and nourishing food, administering
drugs only to check the symptoms until the system
gets into condition to throw them off. More
than that, we know now that consumption, at
least, is not a mysterious dispensation of Providence
visited upon certain people without regard
to individual responsibility. Rather it is
always the result of improper living or thinking,
or both, and, when it is the scourge of a
district, as in thickly settled city slums, it is
the direct result of monopoly and oppression
that deny the common interests of all mankind.</p>

<p>In 1865 Dr. W. W. Hall of New York published
his book, “Sleep,” in the preface of
which he said: “It is the end and aim of this
book to show that as a means of high health,
good blood, and a strong mind to old and young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>111</span>,
sick or well, each one should have a single bed
in a large, clean, light room, so as to pass all
the hours of sleep in a pure, fresh air, and that
those who fail in this, will in the end fail in
health and strength of limb and brain, and will
die while yet their days are not all told.”
That this physician with a large practice
should find it necessary to write a book to set
forth the necessity of fresh air during sleeping-hours,
goes to show how little the mass of
our people knew even fifty years ago. We hear
so much about fresh air in these days that we
forget that the preceding generation was in
deadly terror of it.</p>

<p>All things point to a marked advance during
the past decades, in the understanding of conditions
necessary for health, but, after all, we
have come but a very little way along the road
we must travel to get the most out of life.</p>

<p>We owe a good deal of our advance in this
direction to physicians and others who have
broken loose from traditions and have not
feared to put their ideas and discoveries to the
test. Nature has provided all things for “the
healing of the nations,” if we but trust her. As
Dr. Shattuck, a famous Boston surgeon, used
to say in making his rounds in the Massachusetts
General Hospital, “There is one inestimable
gift God has given to man—an abundance
of fresh air.” It was his method of
announcing that he did not think the ventilation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>112</span>
of room or ward was sufficient, and the nurses
understood that, and immediately admitted
more air into the room.</p>

<p>In the wards of that great institution were
dozens of persons who had never before heard
of the value of fresh air: being compelled by
evil social conditions to live in districts where
sunshine and air were rarities, they had never
heard of any relation between health and fresh
air. They frequently learned that lesson there.</p>

<p>A little device which we call “the Perfect
Gift of Sleep” is a great help in excluding the
light without excluding the air, and especially
valuable in that most delightful change, sleeping
out of doors. A bag is made of dark green
or blue or black silk or satin, about four inches
wide and eight inches long, and very loosely
filled with sweet pine needles. It is laid lightly
over the eyes.</p>

<p>This may seem too trivial to bother about,
but the increased comfort and the better quality
of sleep which it brings is astonishing.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>  is not so necessary now as when Dr. Hall
wrote to urge the importance of large, airy
sleeping-rooms. But it is amazing to find how
many, even among the so-called “better
classes,” neglect to open their windows wide
at night. I have known people out in the country
whose bedroom windows could hardly be
made to open, so seldom did they admit the air.
Indeed, they were also heavily shaded so that
they might not admit the sunshine.</p>

<p>That such people have been able to live at
all is due to the patience of Nature, or to the
fact that so much of the day is spent in the
open air that it helps to counteract the effect
of the closed-up night. Even then they do not
escape early wrinkles, bent shoulders, and a
look of age long before their time. We used
to attribute these to the hard work of the
farmer’s life, but we might more properly attribute
it to improper living.</p>

<p>Besides an abundance of fresh air day and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>114</span>
night, summer and winter, personal cleanliness
immensely aids to health and the ability to
sleep. In the old days we bathed to clean ourselves
when dirty. It was an advance on that
when someone said he took a bath every spring
and fall, whether he needed it or not. In those
days once a week was considered frequent.
To-day we bathe to keep clean.</p>

<p>Someone, probably Joseph Fels, has said that
the civilization of a people may best be estimated
by the amount of soap and water it consumes.
If we start out well-groomed in the
morning—fresh from the bath with clean linen,
clothes brushed and all our personal needs duly
attended to—we carry our heads higher, feel
an uplift of body and mind that is impossible
to the careless or untidy person.</p>

<p>The same influence applies to going to bed
at night. If we retire soiled and worn from the
day’s experiences, we may toss and turn with
discomfort whose source we may not understand,
or we fall into heavy, unrefreshing sleep.
The body does most of its breathing during
sleeping-time. You know how the moisture
from the breath shows on a mirror when you
breathe on it: well, the skin gives off about
three times as much moisture as the breath,
and, unless the pores of the skin are free from
all obstructions such as dust, old, dried perspiration,
and similar soil, it cannot perform its
work properly and to the advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>115</span>
sleeper. If you don’t like water, use oil as the
Easterns do. Even dry rubbing, if the skin is
moist, will keep the pores open.</p>

<p>The little trouble entailed is more than offset
by the refreshed feeling, the lightening of the
mind as well as of the body, the more restful
sleep, and the better health resulting from the
practice.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of the night bath is
that it reminds us to change all the clothes we
have worn during the day. If they must be
worn again the next day, they should be spread
out on the backs of chairs or on hangers, that
they may be thoroughly aired before morning.
If we feel that we must have something more
than the pajamas or night-robe, then there
should be separate sets of underclothes kept
for that purpose alone—old, thin, partly-worn
ones may be reserved for this use.</p>

<p>Whether baths should be hot, warm, or cold
must depend upon the individual. There is no
set rule that applies equally to all persons.
Many persons find the cold plunge or shower
most invigorating in the morning,—it is too
stimulating to be taken at night—and others
cannot stand the shock of contact with cold water
at any time. There is but one wise thing
to do—to experiment for yourself and adopt the
sort of bath that seems best suited to your
needs. Most people will find the warm bath
more satisfactory than the hot or cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>116</span></p>

<p>And remember that it is not only the lungs
that need fresh air: the skin needs it too, and,
next to overeating, the quickest way to “catch” cold is to bundle up in heavy perspiration-holding
flannels. Linen mesh is excellent, but,
whatever underclothing is worn, it should not
suffocate the millions of pores of the skin.</p>

<p>An airy room, free from hangings, carpets,
street clothes, and all other dust-gatherers; a
clean body; a contented mind—these are important
factors both in sleep and in general
health, and, best of all, they are inexpensive
enough to be within the reach of nearly everybody.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span>  of the most common causes of ill-health
and sleeplessness is improper
breathing. Breathing is the fundamental function
of life, the first at birth and the last at
death, and when it is badly performed we are
sure to have trouble. The great majority of
people never use the whole of their lungs in
breathing. By this neglect the blood is never
sufficiently oxygenated to burn out all impurities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>118</span></p>

<p>But you may say, “I am not responsible for
the way I breathe; I do that “automatically,” and you would be in a degree correct. It is
true that we are not conscious of the act of
breathing. It would be an intolerable burden
upon the mind if every breath required conscious
attention. We could hardly attend to
anything else.</p>

<p>That is no reason, however, why we should
not regulate our breathing for our own benefit.
Breathing, though an habitual organic act, is
under the indirect control of the higher centers
of the nervous system. We must, as Dr.
Worcester says, re-educate the lower centers to
breathe, and to do this it is necessary to give
conscious attention to it for a time. If we wish
to replace bad breathing by good breathing, we
must fix our attention regularly upon drawing
the breath, practice the right sort of breathing,
and impress upon the vital mechanism that
this new order of breathing is to be adopted,
for the way to be rid of a bad habit is to replace
it with a good one. If we persevere in
this course, the right method can very easily be
established.</p>

<p>By the right method is meant breathing from
the diaphragm. If you will watch the act of
breathing among your friends for even one day,
you will discover for yourself how few do it
well. The great majority breathe with the
upper part of the lungs only, so that the chest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>119</span>
visibly rises and falls in time with the inhalations
and exhalations. Such persons may be
unconscious of their own breathing, but they
make all who observe them conscious of it.
They are not only injuring themselves, but making
a claim upon the attention of others that is
scarcely justifiable.</p>

<p>Quick, short breathing is one of the signs
either of excitement or of depression, some
pleasurable or painful emotion or sensation,
but it is not a means to health. If we have this
habit, we may find in it an explanation of many
of the trifling ills and discomforts from which
we suffer, and of not a few of the more serious
ones.</p>

<p>Emily M. Bishop, who has given much study
to the effect of our habits of mind and body
upon our health and spirits, says, in her latest
book, “Daily Ways of Living,” that we may
change the whole current of our thought by a
change in breathing. She wisely advises her
readers the next time they feel depressed or
worried, “blue,” or “miserable,” to try drawing
deep, full breaths. If you are not in good
spirits, try that now: “spirit” means the
breath.</p>

<p>Open the windows and let in fresh air, if
within doors; inhale deeply, hold it, and then
exhale rather quickly. After only four or five
such inhalations you will find that the miserable
feeling has disappeared or is greatly les<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>120</span>sened.
The “blues” cannot live while good
red blood is circulating rapidly through the
veins and arteries. It is only when the blood is
sluggish or not sufficiently purified by the indrawn
oxygen that worry and depression can
hold us in their thrall. Deep breathing is a simple
remedy for the blues, but its effectiveness
makes it worth trying.</p>

<p>Proper breathing will often ward off a cold,
especially a cold due to chill. As soon as you
feel yourself getting chilly, act. The feeling of
chilliness is a proof that the resistance of
the body is below normal. The cause may
be interior, due to the presence of some
poison in the system, or it may be due entirely
to external causes. In either event,
to purify the blood and improve its circulation
is the best sort of “first aid to the
injured.”
Inhale until you can feel it in your fingers
and toes, exhale quickly, and repeat the operation
until you feel all aglow. Mlle. Marie de
Palkowska, whose special work is teaching correct
breathing, says: “The nerve centers are
directly affected by the condition of the blood,
and they are enfeebled, contracted, or irritated
by an excess of carbon and nitrogen in it, producing
depression of spirits; but, if the blood
is circulating freely, the nerves are quieted
and well-nourished by the supply of oxygen,
through the process of correct breathing, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>121</span>
the result is perfect health of mind and body
and a happy optimism.”
Worry, sleeplessness, and disease do not
easily lay hold upon one who has “perfect
health of mind and body and a happy optimism.” If these may be secured through intelligent
attention to breathing, there is no reason
why they should not be as common as they
are natural. The more we look into the question
of health, whether physical, mental, or
moral, the more clearly we see that poise is
only possible through conformity to universal
law. It could not be otherwise.</p>

<p>Earlier in this inquiry we have traced the
interdependence, the unity of man’s three natures—the
physical, the mental, and the spiritual,—and
the value of correct breathing to the
whole man is in perfect keeping with that interdependence.
In the process of digestion, upon
which physical health so largely depends, we
create poisons within ourselves and accumulate
waste matter. The organism must be momently
purified of these wastes, or putrefaction quickly
follows. Autotoxins form, as the doctors say.
The function of breathing, when properly controlled,
affords the quickest and best method
of cleansing the blood of these impurities. If
we have not this proper control, the poisons
are not eliminated and the supply of blood to
the brain is vitiated.</p>

<p>Just as the body cannot perform its functions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>122</span>
well if we are compelled to live upon tainted
food, so the brain cannot do its work well if
the blood—its food—is impure. Breathing
which expands the diaphragm so purifies the
blood as it passes through the lungs, that it becomes
an important factor in maintaining
health and poise in body and mind, which in
their turn react upon the spirit.</p>

<p>This sort of breathing is more common
among men than among women, due in part to
natural physical differences and in part to
dress. Man breathes largely from the abdomen,
while woman breathes chiefly from the
chest, expanding only the upper portion of the
lungs. This is partly a natural and
partly an artificial necessity, due to the pressure
of the corset upon the diaphragm. Both
men and women would find their physical
health improved and their outlook on life
broadened and brightened by proper control of
the function of breathing. If we are sleepless,
nervous, too alert, as well as if we are heavy,
dull, and inactive, we will find it worth our
while to try conscious breath control. It takes
but a comparatively short time to re-educate
the automatic centers into correct breathing
and the result is always good.</p>

<p>It no less behooves the man who is trying to
live largely on the rational plane, than the
man who is living wholly on the physical plane,
to make his efforts both easier and more ef<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>123</span>fective
by such simple attention to natural laws.
The next time you are worried, depressed, or
sleepless, change the air of the room and try
deep and correct breathing for a few minutes.
You will be surprised at the complete change
wrought in you, if you are not suffering from
some serious organic breakdown which needs
skilled attention. And even that condition may
be helped by proper breathing.</p>

<p>But we are not to forget that, like calisthenic
and gymnastic exercises, the training of the
breathing is really little more than a device for
correcting the results of wrong living and only
a substitute for right living. The man or the
woman who does plenty of healthful, normal
work, who often pants and gets “out of
breath,” naturally expands the lungs and has
as little use for breathing exercises as for tight
clothing.</p>

<p>A buck-saw, a spade, or even a broom is better
than a teacher of breathing and a better
corrector of sleeplessness.</p>

<p>He points out that the greatly increased number
of persons who remain physically and mentally
active past the age of seventy-five and
eighty years is itself a proof that life may be
prolonged. He recognizes that merely to extend
existence is not a sufficient end to work
for—it must be an active, worthwhile existence,
and he has experimented toward this end.</p>

<p>All of us can recall instances of “old people” who have preserved their physical and
mental faculties until their last years. We have
been in the habit of regarding these people as
exceptions and have perhaps not noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>125</span>
these “exceptions” are already almost frequent
enough to prove that there is no such
rule for longevity.</p>

<p>Whenever we investigate a new and wonderful
thing, we find that its causes are simple and
ordinary. So Metchnikoff and kindred experimenters
are beginning to show us that prolonging
life is a comparatively simple matter. It
comes back again to diet and sleep on the
physical side and to understanding of the universal
laws on the mental and the emotional
side of life.</p>

<p>All scientific men agree that nearly all of us
eat too much, or eat improper food. Most
of them say that we sleep too much, or try to
sleep too much. They advise simple diet, varied
but not heavy. It is probable that the
early human being ate as the wild animals do,
to appease hunger, and had to eat whatever he
could find without regard to taste. As civilization
advanced and he learned ways of getting
increased returns from Nature, he began to select
and choose what he should eat. In this
way he developed “appetite” as apart from
natural hunger, and as his knowledge increased,
and his taste became more and more refined, appetite
gradually took the place of hunger.</p>

<p>People ordinarily seldom know the pleasure
of satisfying real hunger. Because of habit,
the appetite stirs as often as three or five times
a day and we gratify it. We must have certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>126</span>
foods prepared in a certain way. Eating becomes
an end in itself, rather than merely a
means to an end. If appetite is fully indulged,
he becomes heavy, suffers from indigestion and
sleeplessness, talks of stomach trouble and consequent
“loss of appetite.” He seeks a physician
to restore what he is really better without.
Not every physician is as wise as the one
to whom a cook once applied. She told her
story of inability to eat her meals, of uncertain
and unrestful sleep, increased weight, and
shortness of breath. The physician heard her
tale of woe and asked her the size of the family
for which she cooked and about their mode of
living. He learned that the family consisted of
five, and that they entertained lavishly. “Do
you taste all the food you prepare?” was the
next question.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I must taste it to be sure it is
just right.”
“Ah!” replied the doctor; “put on a plate
exactly the same quantity of everything that
you take to taste—no more, no less—and send
it to me to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>Much to the cook’s astonishment, at the close
of the next day, which had included a dinner-party,
there was a heaping platter of food,
more than she would have thought it possible
to eat even at three meals.</p>

<p>“It is not a tonic you want,” said the physician.
“You already eat too much, which a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>127</span>ccounts
for your loss of appetite, shortness of
breath, and sleeplessness. It may be necessary
for you to taste all the food you cook, but take
smaller ‘tastes’ and eat nothing else on cooking
days. I cannot help you; you must help
yourself.” (Being an ignorant woman, she
went to another doctor and got some ill-tasting
drug.)</p>

<p>And such is, after all, the decision of all the
scientific investigators into the life and health
of men: We must help ourselves by understanding
the laws of life and observing them.</p>

<p>Most rich persons are really like the man
who applied to his physician about “loss of appetite.” “Try beginning dinner with raw oysters,” said the doctor. In a few days the
patient returned, to say that the oysters did no
good.</p>

<p>“Maybe you didn’t eat enough?” said the
doctor.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man, “I ate four dozen.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“T<span class="smcap">here</span> are more things in heaven and
earth than are dreamt of” in anybody’s
philosophy or understanding of living; it is not
strange that the great mass have not dreamed
of eating as a cause of sleeplessness and ill-health,
though they may dream in consequence
of it. It is generally believed that a hearty
meal of any indigestible food immediately before
bed is bad for sleep: yet animals and
primitive men always sleep after they are
gorged. But few recognize that the whole plan
of eating may be responsible for sleeplessness
or excessive sleepiness. For, like fatigue, food
may either bring or prevent sleep.</p>

<p>In these days not even the most fastidious
will object to a discussion of the ethics and
æsthetics of feeding. It is no longer “the
gratification of a vulgar necessity,” but a matter
of keen scientific interest. Colleges give
courses in the chemistry of food that we may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>129</span>
know what combinations it is wise to make,
while some of the leading universities have
made severe practical tests of some of the new
“fads in eating.”
There are so many theories of eating to-day
that one may take his choice, and, if the quality
of both health and sleep is not improved, he
can run through the list and then take what is
best of each.</p>

<p>When Dr. W. W. Hall wrote his book on fresh
air in the sleeping-room, he added, in a casual
sort of way, this piece of advice to the would-be
sleeper, “Always eat slowly and in moderation
of well-divided food.” That is advice that will
bear infinite repetition. It is really the keynote
of all the present-day theories of eating. It applies
equally well to omnivorous and vegetarian
peoples.</p>

<p>Horace Fletcher says, “You may eat anything
you like, if you eat it at the right time and
in the right way,” and, when one has learned
what Mr. Fletcher thinks is the right time and
way, one has grasped the whole of “Fletcherism.” It consists in eating only when one is
hungry—so hungry that “the mouth waters
and one could stand and whinny like a horse
at the smell of bread”—and then chewing just
as long as there is any taste left to the food. I
have known children to get the habit of eating
too fast, with indigestion and restlessness as a
consequence, because the nurse stood beside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>130</span>
table with a spoonful always ready and waiting
while the last was being swallowed. We may
avoid that habit for ourselves or cure ourselves
of it by always laying down the knife and fork
or spoon after each mouthful. This insures
some time to chew.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of all those who have special
theories on “what to eat and how to eat it” that civilized man scarcely knows what true
hunger is. We are so in the habit of eating
at fixed and customary hours that we create
“habit hunger,” which has but slight connection
with Nature’s demands for sustenance. In
accordance with this idea, fasting is again becoming
popular and all sorts of good results
are claimed for it. The “devil of unrest and
disease” is now being reckoned among “those
that go not out but by fasting and prayer.” Fasting and prayer meant the physical and the
spiritual treatment together.</p>

<p>Fasting has long been imposed upon man as
a religious rite, generally as penance for some
“sin,” but now it is being advised and self-imposed
for the sake of its physical advantages.
It may well be that the habit of fasting
for health’s sake originated with prehistoric
man and was diverted into religious channels
and its original significance forgotten. So
many “religious rites” have come about in
this way that it is fair to assume that fasting
may have, also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>131</span></p>

<p>However that may be, the practice is coming
into scientific prominence, and Charles C. Haskell
in his book, “Perfect Health: How to Get
it and How to Keep it, by One Who Has It,” made much of the importance of fasting. If
one is ill, fasting will make him well, according
to Mr. Haskell. He gives numerous instances
of the benefits that have followed fasts
extending from one to nine or even more days.
Mr. Upton Sinclair has written of his happy experience
of abstinence in “The Fasting Cure.” As soon as the system is ready for food, true
hunger will appear, says Mr. Haskell, and, like
Mr. Fletcher, he regards “watering at the
mouth”—the free flow of saliva—as the best
index of real hunger.</p>

<p>But, unlike Fletcher, Haskell is a vegetarian
pure and simple, as that word is generally understood.
Haskell says, “Nature has provided
a natural food for man, and it is the vegetable
kingdom.” He also strongly urges upon the
seeker for sound health, which means sound
sleep, to give up the habit of taking breakfast,
thus conquering appetite and restoring real
hunger. This is, indeed, the first precept he
lays down; and the second is much like it. It
runs, “Never eat except at the call of Natural
Hunger.” Third, “Enjoy to the full every
mouthful of food as long as any taste remains
in it.” Fourth, “Do not drink any liquids
with your meals.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>132</span>
The rules are simple enough to follow if you
have any cause to suspect that your mode of
life is the cause of “poor sleep.” This book
has no special brand of food to recommend, nor
does it intend to say what any man should or
should not eat. Sir Henry Thompson is about
right when he says that “No man can tell another
what he can or ought to eat, without
knowing what are the habits of life and work—mental
and bodily—of the person to be advised.
One rule cannot apply to all.”</p>

<p>All that the writer aims to do is to set forth
the best theories of how to insure sound sleep
and good health, and to leave it to the individual
reader to try whichever he thinks fits.
It is what he will do, anyway, if he is a wise
man; for only by following the course he most
desires can he learn whether these desires are
to be trusted as guides to happiness and well-being.</p>

<p>But—most persons eat too much or too often
or too fast. Maybe you do, too.</p>

<small>SOME MODERN THEORIES OF SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.<br />

<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span>  have been almost as many theories
of sleep and its causes as there have
been investigators, but these theories may be
grouped under a few main heads:</p>

<p>Physiological, or that which has to do with
some bodily conditions only, and which made
men think that sleep was dependent upon the
circulation of the blood or upon decreased consumption
of oxygen, was an early one of these
theories. It has had many advocates and has
led to many interesting experiments that have
increased the sum of general knowledge, although
they have not explained sleep.</p>

<p>Delicate instruments, with formidable names,
have been invented and successfully used to
measure the intensity of sleep and to note its
phenomena. Two of the experimenters—C. E.
Brush, Jr., and R. Fayerweather of the Physiological
Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University—through
long, intricate and exhaustive
experiments, have found that sleep is most in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>134</span>tense
and the pressure of blood in the arteries
lowest during the first half of the sleeping
period. After we have completed the first half
of our sleep, the intensity or soundness of sleep
becomes less, and the pressure of blood in the
arteries continues to increase up to the moment
of awaking.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn that the moment
when we are most soundly sleeping is at the
end of the first hour of sleep, and that the
blood-pressure has at that time reached its very
lowest point. Messrs. Brush and Fayerweather
report that, during the first few hours of sleep,
the blood-pressure continues to fall and then
begins a gradual rise. The tendency is to more
and more rapid flow of the blood, but this rise
is not steady or regular, because it is broken
by long waves when the force of the circulation
falls and the pulse is weaker than it was a
moment or two before. The rapidity of the
blood-flow is greater on the moment of awakening
than just before dropping to sleep. This
increase is not sudden, but is the culmination of
the rise that begins a few hours after we fall
asleep. (See Appendix B.)</p>

<p>The intensity or depth of sleep is shown by
a curve that looks like a pile of sand with
the top scooped off. It increases rather slowly,
in most cases, for the first quarter-hour: then
quickly, so that half an hour later the person
is most “sound asleep.” He stays so, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>135</span>
level top, for about half an hour. That is the
time that wise burglars and late husbands
choose to steal into the house, about an hour
after everyone is asleep. After that time the
sleeper reverses the process of falling into deep
sleep by getting nearer to waking for half an
hour and then getting, at first rapidly, nearer
to waking for two or three hours. In the last
three or four hours healthy and normal persons
reach about the same proportions of time and
intensity of sleep, so that the Indian-bow-shaped
curve fairly represents how long it takes everybody
to deepen his sleep. Kohlschütter found
how great an intensity of sound was needed to
awaken a sleeper at different periods throughout
the night. His curve thus made tallies very
exactly with that of Brush and Fayerweather,
obtained in quite a different way.</p>

<p>Some other investigators have pointed out
that, interesting as this theory is, it proves one
thing about as completely as it does the other.
For, while it is plain that sleep and the great
fall in blood-pressure exist at the same moment,
it is not conclusively shown which is
cause and which is effect. Does sleep cause the
fall in blood-pressure, or does the fall in blood-pressure
cause sleep? The two are coexistent,
but who can say which begins first?</p>

<p>It looks as if sleep might be more justly considered
the cause, if one takes the sleeping-position,
and maintains the attitude of mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>136</span>
suitable to induce sleep, blood-pressure grows
less, even though the patient does not actually
fall asleep.</p>

<p>Under this physiological view must come
also the chemical theory based on the fact that
we consume more oxygen during the day, thus
forming carbon dioxide and other poisons
which cause sleepiness. During the night we
absorb oxygen, building up the tissues, and
eliminating the poisons of the waking hours.</p>

<p>The poisons which are the result of the consumption
of oxygen cause fatigue, and according
to Preyer, a European authority, “sleep is
the direct consequence of fatigue, or rather of
the fatigue products in the blood.” His contention
is that, if lactic acid and other chemical
products of the consumption of oxygen in the
body were injected artificially, sleep would follow.
Experiments in this direction made by
Preyer, Fisher, and L. Meyer have yielded such
contradictory results that the theory is not
proved thereby.</p>

<p>The idea that sleep is the result of poisons
in the system takes us into the pathological
theory of sleep, which regards it as a sort of
disease like epilepsy or auto-intoxication. We
produce by our own activities the poisons which
cause insensibility until the system cleanses itself.
Professor Leo Errera of Brussels says
that “work in the organism is closely bound
up with a chemical breaking down.” Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>137</span>
the products of this breakdown are “leucomaines,” the scientific name for poisons formed
in living tissue, and just the opposite to “ptomaines,” which, however, are also virulent
poisons.</p>

<p>Professor Errera tells us that, during our
waking hours, we produce more leucomaines
than the oxygen we absorb can destroy. This
excess is carried along by the blood and held by
the brain centers, and in time produces sleep,
just as any poisonous anæsthetic, such as morphine,
would produce sleep.</p>

<p>While we are sleeping we absorb much oxygen
and we recover from the effects of our
self-intoxication. Errera maintains that work,
fatigue, sleep, and repair are not merely successive
events, but phenomena chained together
in a regular and necessary cycle. He explains
sleeplessness due to overfatigue on the theory
that small doses of poisons induce sleep and
large doses induce excitement and even convulsions.</p>

<p>Manacéïne points out that this theory is good
from a purely physical standpoint, but does not
explain our power to postpone sleep or the faculty
of waking at a fixed hour. We can do both,
and any adequate theory of sleep must explain
why we can control the tendency to sleep, but
cannot control the symptoms of ordinary poisoning.</p>

<small>EARLY THEORIES OF SLEEP</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">Balm that tames all anguish.<br />

<span class="smcap">Wordsworth.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Mr. Edward Binns</span> of London, as early
as 1842, published a book called “The
Anatomy of Sleep”—with the subtitle, “The
Art of Procuring Sound and Refreshing Slumber
at Will.” The subtitle makes one think of
the three-volume novels of that time, but the
book is fairly concise and worth careful review.
Moreover, it is in advance of many works on
sleep both before and after. (For ancient surmises
see Appendix C.)</p>

<p>One of the favorite medical theories of sleep
is that it is caused by fatigue, and is, therefore,
purely passive in its nature. Binns did not accept
this theory. He said, “Sleep is an active
and positive faculty, not a negative and passive
result of fatigue or weariness.” Some of the
more modern writers, notably Manacéïne, agree
with Dr. Binns that sleep is not the result of
physical fatigue or weariness. Dr. Binns
thinks that one proof that fatigue can in no
sense be said to be the cause of sleep is that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>139</span>
if we prolong “the state of wakefulness after
the usual period of retiring to rest, it is more
difficult to induce sleep than if we went at the
usual hour.” This is especially true of children,
yet the patient may be much more fatigued
at the later hour than at the usual bedtime.</p>

<p>Binns’ theory is that physiological sleep is in
antagonism to intellectual activity, being the
active process of nutrition, assimilation of
food, or of the repair of the waste of the body;
that it concerns the nerve centers: that is,
“the ganglionic system.” It is a generally admitted
theory that man’s activity, whether
physical or mental, “uses up” tissue and
nerve force, and that it is only when repair exceeds
this waste that life is maintained at a
high standard. If the activities of life be many
and varied, much sleep according to this theory
would be needed to repair the waste of force.
Experience has shown that those who live
purely physical lives, doing hard manual labor
with little mental exercise, need the most sleep.
Those whose activities are mostly mental generally
sleep fewer hours, though the desire for
sleep may be as intense when it comes as is
that of the manual laborer. (See Appendix,
Questionnaire.)</p>

<p>Regarding sleep as a necessity, in itself an
“active and positive faculty,” Binns says of
it that “it is the true ‘vis medicatrix naturæ’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>140</span> —the healing force of nature—to whose vigilance
we are indebted for that condition of mind
and body called ‘health.’” However, he is not
an advocate of long hours of sleep for everybody.
He thinks individuals differ widely in
the amount of sleep needed. He makes the general
statement that, “the lower the cerebral organs
in the scale of organization, the greater
the power of sleep.” On this point all the authorities
agree, and even in our own experience
we learn that. The animals nearest to man in
point of development sleep more than man
sleeps; and, among men, those who live the most
sluggish mental and emotional lives sleep
longer than those whose brains are more active.</p>

<p>There may, of course, be exceptions to this
rule, and yet those exceptions would not disprove
that there is a rule. Much depends, says
the good doctor, upon the peculiarities “of the
individual; the culture of his mind; his amusement,
his food, his occupation, and the temper
with which he wooes sleep. General Elliot
never slept more than four hours out of twenty-four,
and his food consisted wholly of bread,
vegetables, and water.”
This seems like one more link in the chain
that binds up our habits of eating with our
power to sleep. Just as heavy eating late at
night may so disturb our slumber as to leave
us practically sleepless, so general heavy eating
may render us so incapable of mental ac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>141</span>tivity
that sleep may take possession of us.
General Elliot’s slight need of sleep was probably
due, in large measure, to his light diet, and
Dr. Binns seems to be of that opinion. We notice
that flesh-eating animals, especially serpents,
gorge and then sleep long.</p>

<p>A modern medical authority, Sir Henry
Thompson of London, in his book, “Diet in
Relation to Age and Activity,” takes somewhat
similar ground, although careful to state that
he is not “a vegetarian.” He says: “I have
been compelled by facts to accept the conclusion
that as much mischief in the form of actual
disease, impaired vigor and shortened life accrues
to civilized man, so far as I have observed
in our own country and throughout almost
every part of Europe, from erroneous habits in
eating as from the habitual use of alcoholic
drink, considerable as I know the evil of that
to be.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span>  is another class of investigators who
aim to explain what might be called the
nervous mechanism of sleep rather than its
causes. These are the histologists, and theirs
is the “histological” theory of sleep. There
is a vast literature on this one phase of sleep
theorizing alone, and it is deeply interesting to
those who, in order to understand this theory,
are willing to wrestle with the difficult and technical
terms.</p>

<p>The general reader, unfamiliar with physiological
terms, is bewildered by such a word as
“neuroglia.” He wonders what sort of a fossil
that is, when in fact it is merely a particular
sort of tissue found in the central nervous system;
a substance without any nervous property
serving a purpose merely similar to cement.
So that, after all, like much science, it
is simple enough when put in plain words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>143</span></p>

<p>Some histologists hold that the neuroglia is
able to contract or expand; that, when expanded,
it takes or receives impressions from
without, and, when it contracts, it shuts out
such impressions, thus inducing sleep. Dr. J.
Leonard Corning, of New York, says that
“Sleep may be defined as that state of the central
nervous system in which the higher centers
are, to a great extent, in a condition of
physiological quiescence, with all the consequences
thereby implied.”
Dr. Corning means that the nervous centers
of the brain are inactive, as a result of contraction,
and that this state results in drowsiness
and in consequent loss of the consciousness.
He recognizes, however, that this purely physical
condition does not always produce sleep;
that there may be disturbing causes within.
He says: “Those who suffer from sleeplessness
are, almost without exception, beset by a
variety of disagreeable mental symptoms during
the day, dread of impending evil, irritability,
depression, dread of society, etc.” Although these are often the result of wrong
states of mind or heart, he recommends for
such cases warm baths, Turkish baths, massage,
and for obstinate cases he even suggests the use
of drugs, because he regards the formation of
habits of insomnia as more likely than the formation
of the drug habit. This suggestion is
not generally favored by the investigators of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>144</span>
sleep, the most of whom discountenance the use
of drugs. Almost everyone has known somebody
who contracted the “drug habit,” or has
heard of somebody who died from the effects of
an overdose of some poison taken to induce
sleep. Nobody should dose himself with drugs,
hoping to get good results from sleep thus secured.
It is wiser by far to discover the cause
of sleeplessness and remove it, rather than
merely to stupefy ourselves for the time being.</p>

<p>It was as a worker along histological lines
that Henry Hubbard Foster of Cornell University
became convinced that sleep is induced by
the absence of stimuli: that is, of things that attract
and hold our attention. It may be that the
individual withdraws from all stimulating conditions
and creates conditions to cause sleep, as
we do when we prepare for bed; or it may be
that, because of fatigue, our senses do not respond
to the things that would otherwise stimulate
us. In either event, the result is the same—there
is an absence of stimuli.</p>

<p>Foster believes that the present state of our
development is not sufficient to meet the demands
of continuous activity of the senses and
the brain. “If it were not for fatigue,” he
says, “the development of the nervous system
might be carried to such a point that consciousness
could be present continuously.” He finds
the reason for sleep in “a temporary derangement
of the nervous system.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>145</span>
According to Boris Sidis of Harvard, who
has experimented extensively on frogs, cats,
birds, dogs, children, and adults, the cells of
the central nervous system, by expanding and
contracting, connect themselves with, or cut
themselves off from the whole nervous system,
and induce “waking-states and sleeping-states.” The purely scientific man is forever
aiming to reduce all the phenomena of human
life to a simple formula. But no formula has
yet been discovered which includes all phases of
life to the satisfaction of all its students.
Hence we have so many different theories of
so natural and universal a function as sleep,
none of them perfectly satisfactory even to
their discoverers or inventors, and none affording
any great help to those who want to know
how to sleep.</p>

<p>This whole neuron theory, as it is called,
of dilating and contracting is really no more
complete an explanation than any of the others.
No perfect explanation of any natural
function can be given until we can fully explain
life. That has not yet been done. The most
advanced biologists can say, “Here life appears,” but they cannot absolutely define life
any more than they can create it out of inanimate
things.</p>

<p>We know, however, that in sleep, sight, nearly
useless to man in the gloom of night, goes
first to rest. Next taste goes. Then smell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>146</span>
still so useful to animals, deserts us. Then
touch is dulled. Last of all, the hearing relaxes
its guard, though with some persons it stays
long awake. Noise will arouse us quicker than
a touch; and last the light.</p>

<p>As you drop off to sleep you can notice the
decreased sensation in the long-serving feet
which feels as if it slowly climbs to the muscles
in the head and neck.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span>  have not yet exhausted all the theories,
nor shown how much too much some of
them and how far too little all of them prove.</p>

<p>The two remaining scientific theories of sleep
are the psychological and the biological. The
best modern exponent of the psychological
theory is Marie de Manacéïne, who defines sleep
as “the resting-time of consciousness.” Persons
whose consciousness is but little developed,
young children, and those of weak intellect,
usually require a great deal of sleep, while
persons whose minds are active, alert, responsive,
get along with comparatively little sleep.</p>

<p>For a long time it was believed that living
creatures devoid of consciousness would not
sleep at all, but recent experiments have
apparently weakened that conclusion. Dogs,
pigeons, and other animals deprived of brains
in the interest of scientific discovery, appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>148</span>
to sleep, that is, they have periods of inactivity,
just as those with brains and consciousness.
Belmondo, after repeated experiments,
drew the conclusion that sleep is not a purely
cerebral function, as some believe, but that the
whole organism sleeps; and the brain sleeps
only because the organs of sense sleep. This,
however, is doubtful.</p>

<p>And this is in sum and substance the biological
theory of sleep, that the whole organism
sleeps, but even here there are exceptions. It
is true that the heart beats less rapidly; that
we breathe less frequently; that the brain cells
cease their functioning because the neuroglia
contracts and shuts off or lessens their joint
activity; the motor consciousness rests; the
nerves of sensation refuse to be stimulated, we
sleep. Yet we know that the spinal cord never
sleeps, that certain functions of the body continue
uninterruptedly in the sleeping-state as
in the waking-state, and, after all these years
of theorizing and experimenting, we do not
know definitely what sleep is. We know the
mechanism of sleep, its manifestations and its
effects; we know that continued sleeplessness
means madness and death; that sleep is essential
to the physical and mental well-being of the
human organism, but we do not know what sleep
is any more than we know what life is. There
is a limit to what material science can know.</p>

<p>Heubel, who is one of the recent supporters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>149</span>
of the psychological theory of sleep, says that
“Mental activity depends on the incoming
peripheral sensory stimulations; when such
peripheral sensory stimulations are absent,
mental activity is in abeyance and sleep results.” This is, in effect, to say that, when
things about us no longer give us any sensation,
when they do not attract or hold our attention,
we fall asleep. But we all know of
exceptions to this rule. We have seen others
fall into “a brown study,” and have probably
done so ourselves, and become perfectly lost to
all about them; absorbed in their own reflections,
they neither hear nor see the things happening
around them. For the time being
“peripheral sensory stimulations” are absent,
and yet mental activity continues and sleep does
not result.</p>

<p>The biological theory of sleep considers all
the other theories, while formulating its own,
because biology considers the whole organism
and not only one organ or function of the body.
From a different point of view Binns’ theory
is confirmed by Claperède, who points out that,
“biologically regarded, sleep has its significance
not as a passive state, but as an active
instinct, like all the other instincts of animal
life.”
There is a degree of satisfaction to be found
in this theory. It might be stated in this way,
that, when man has had during any period all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>150</span>
the sensations and experiences he can digest,
the instinct to sleep takes possession of him.
It is not that he becomes helpless in the hands
of those experiences, but that his whole nature,
like his stomach, knows when it has had food
enough, and desires time for digestion and assimilation
before it takes in more. Obviously,
“utter separation from the phenomenal world,” as John Bigelow expresses it, becomes necessary.</p>

<p>In his lectures on Botany at the Royal School
of Medicine in Great Britain, Professor Leo H.
Grindon said: “Man is captured in sleep not by
death but by his better nature; to-day runs in
through a deeper day to become the parent of
to-morrow, and to issue every morning, bright
as the morning of life, and of life-size, from the
peaceful womb of the cerebellum.”
This is the result not of a passive state, but
of an active instinct; it accepts sleep as a time
of growth, not merely a time of rest. Bigelow
says, “Something goes on during sleep which
is a preventive as well as an antidote to
mania,” and, in furtherance of this same idea,
Dr. J. J. G. Wilkinson of the Royal College of
Surgeons of London, argues that it seems “as
if a reason more perfect than reason, and uninfluenced
by its partialities, had been at work
when we were in our beds.”
Even “biologically regarded,” Bigelow is
not far astray when he claims that “our d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>151</span>esire
for sleep is manifestly designed to promote
in us the growth and development of spiritual
graces.” In other words, we desire to sleep,
that we may relate the experiences of our
every-day active life to the sum of knowledge
we already possess by inheritance and past experience,
that we may thereby get a fuller understanding
of life and its purposes.</p>

<p>“It is not uncommon for those who have no
habit or inclination to sleep during the morning
hours of secular days, to be overcome with
somnolency in church soon after the devotional
exercises are begun, and to find it impossible
to derive any edification from them until they
have lost themselves for a moment or two in
absolute unconsciousness. Then they have no
difficulty, sometimes a lively pleasure, in attending
to the exercises which follow. The
worshiper is then withdrawn from the familiar
excitement of customary avocations. It is idle
to suppose that in these few moments of repose,
upright in his pew, he has rested enough, in the
common acceptation of that word, to repair any
waste of tissue that would explain the new sense
of refreshment that ensues. He has received,
in that brief retirement from the world, some
reinforcements which manifestly are not dependent
upon time or space for their efficacy—spiritual
reinforcements, and spiritual reinforcements
only. He has removed himself, or
been removed, further away, out of sight or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>152</span>
hearing or thinking, so to speak, of his phenomenal
life, and nearer to the Source of all
life.” This explanation may or may not be
true. He adds:</p>

<p>“It was quite a common impression among
the ancients that sleepers in temples of religion
were more apt to receive divine communications
there than elsewhere.” (“Mystery of Sleep,” John Bigelow, pp. 94-95.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Good</span>  health and good sleep are so interdependent
that it is as difficult to separate
them into cause and effect as to determine
“which came first, the hen or the egg?”
If it be true that life may be wonderfully prolonged
as soon as we have learned to avoid disease
and exhaustion, and that we may learn to
avoid both by avoiding excess, then it is as much
within our power to live long and well as to
sleep long and well, if we so wish. Senility, the
disease of old age, is now believed to be caused
by germs which flourish in the waste matter
left in the system through improper or excessive
eating.</p>

<p>Metchnikoff, the noted bacteriologist, alleges
that the large intestine is the breeding-place
of these destructive germs. A Dr. Hall arrived
at the same conclusion earlier and combated
his germs with copious water-flooding
of the bowels. So far, Metchnikoff’s experiments
point to the conclusion that lactic acid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>154</span>
destroys them. That is why he recommends the
use of pure buttermilk and has invented a tablet
that, dropped into milk, will convert it into
a wholesome drink for adult man. Discoveries
and inventions of this sort are of great interest
to all who enjoy and seek to prolong life. But
purely physical things cannot take the place
of the mental attitude. The youngest woman
of seventy-nine that I have ever known is one
who says, “Tell me more; I must not get into
such a rut that I cannot grow.” No discovery or
invention will do us much good if we allow
habit to cramp our thought and custom to
stale it.</p>

<p>Science may show us how to avoid disease
and to prolong life, but, if we turn a deaf ear
to her teaching, we shall get no benefit from it.
It is the alert, open mind that profits from discovery
or experience. The sun may shine with
life-giving power, but, if the house be shuttered
and darkened, it will not benefit the dwellers.
So with the mind. If we resolutely shut it
against new ideas, if we refuse to take even
the gift of life and health from an unaccustomed
hand, then we must expect to suffer.</p>

<p>If we would rid ourselves of sleeplessness, of
disease, and dissatisfaction, we must be willing
to let go of every habit, every thought, every
feeling that may injure us. To hug them to us
is merely to invite further suffering, to lessen
our own vigor and our own enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>155</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must hug our habits to us,
if we can see or understand nothing better. No
one can help us beyond what we are willing to
receive: anyone can lead a horse to the water,
but no one can make him drink. If the end in
view seems to us worth the price we must pay,
we pay it. We have no choice; for our desires
push us that way. We often take credit to ourselves
for things for which no credit is due us.
However self-denying an act may seem, it is,
after all, the thing we want most to do, else we
would not do it.</p>

<p>In the same way, if we refuse to profit by the
discoveries and experiments of others, if we
prefer to go on in our old way of suffering, nobody
can really prevent us. It is all a matter
that we must decide. This book does not pretend
to cure any ill. It intends merely to show
what investigation and experience have proved;
to point to possible ways of escape from the
ills with which men now suffer. If it looks desirable
to you, you will only read it; but, until
you have tried it, you cannot say whether it is
good or not.</p>

<small>VAIN REGRETS</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast been called, O Sleep! the friend of woe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ’tis the happy that have called thee so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22"><span class="smcap">Southey.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span>  we lie awake at night to regret
some action of our own because the result
has not been what we desired or expected.
“John the Unafraid” says that “if your misfortune
is not your own fault, you have much to
be glad of. If it is your own fault you have
more to be glad of, since you can prevent that
misfortune from occurring again.”
In either case, therefore, you may follow the
advice given so many years ago, “Rejoice evermore.” At least it is evident that in neither
case need you lose sleep over it: for, according
to your light, you did what seemed to you at the
time best for you to do.</p>

<p>For, to quote Epictetus again, it is not possible
“to judge one thing to be best for me and
seek another.” The thing you did, you did because
it seemed best to do that, and to regret
now and wish you had done something else is, in
reality, to wish that you had been a different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>157</span>
person from what you were, which is a foolish
regret, or, that you had done something different
from what seemed best to do. That would
be a mild form of insanity. You don’t really
regret that you were not insane?</p>

<p>It has no bearing on the case that the outcome
has proved that you were mistaken. You
might never have learned that your course was
not best for you or for others, except by doing
just as you did. Now you have that much more
knowledge than you had before, and you can
use it to help you another time. A man can’t
do any better than he can. You cannot do more
than you <i class="em">know</i>, and you only know what you
have learned by experience. The great majority
of us learn only in the school of personal
experience; the few wise ones learn some things
through the experience of others, by relating
or applying their own experience to the events
in the lives of others. Comparing and reflecting,
they come to see the close relation of act
and consequence, and thus recognize the universal
laws in operation.</p>

<p>Such wisdom may be yours, but it will not
come through regretting that you did not possess
it ready-made. Besides, no misfortune,
whether we are ourselves directly responsible
for it or not, is ever in vain. No matter how
hard and almost unendurable the “misfortune” may have seemed at the time, we shall
find in looking back that it was no unmixed evil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>158</span>
The terrible calamity has often been the turning-point
in our lives. It made us pause and
think, and, through the thinking, we have
achieved development of which we were otherwise
incapable.</p>

<p>Even when we do not always see this for ourselves,
partly because we are not always good
judges of our own development or progress, we
see it plainly in the lives of others. A friend of
mine once said to me of a woman who was doing
a tremendous work in the world, “I remember
when she was just a selfish society woman.”
“What changed her?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, she lost her only daughter very suddenly.
It was a terrible blow, and her friends
thought she would never recover. But she did,
and those who love her best know that that
heavy sorrow was really a blessing in disguise.
Think what she is now!”
I smiled appreciatively, for my friend was
herself still smarting from a keen disappointment
which she had not yet recognized as a
blessing in disguise. But recognizing it in another’s
life must eventually help her to see it
in her own.</p>

<p>If our misfortune has come from a selfishness
that we might have overcome, and did not, we
shall not better matters by wasting time in regret.
“Repentance”—which is the only emotion
such a misfortune should arouse—“is to
up and act for righteousness, and forget that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>159</span>
you ever had relations with sin.” Unless we
“bring forth fruits meet for repentance,” our
repentance is lost, and we are indeed worse off
than if we had felt none.</p>

<p>Spinoza, the Jewish philosopher, has spoken
almost the last word on the uselessness of regret.
He says: “One might perhaps expect
gnawings of conscience and repentance to help
to bring him on the right path, and might thereupon
conclude (as everyone does conclude)
that these affections are good things. Yet when
we look at the matter closely, we shall find that
not only are they not good, but on the contrary
hurtful and evil passions. For it is manifest
that we can always get along better by reason
and love of truth than by worry of conscience
and remorse.”
It is an old Hebrew idea that we should repent
in sackcloth and ashes, making ourselves
miserable that we may make God happy. We
forget that love cannot enjoy anyone’s misery.
It were indeed a perverted mind, whether human
or divine, that could derive pleasure from
the discomfort or sorrow of another.</p>

<p>Plants grow better when the sunshine warms
them, and human beings expand and develop
under the sunshine of joyous reflection and effort.
If you are losing sleep through dreary
or hopeless regret, purge your mind of such
folly, and, after a sound sleep, you will find
that things look brighter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>160</span></p>

<p>There are, of course, exceptions to the rule
that sleep brings mental quiet, for some sorts
of nervous sufferers are prone to depression in
the morning, but it is not common among active,
healthy persons. They, like well-nourished
children, awake to find each day a fresh delight.</p>

<p>Dr. M. Allen Starr, the distinguished nerve
specialist of New York, writes me that there
are several explanations of the cause of such
depression. He is of the opinion that those who
are depressed from melancholia when they wake
in the morning, are probably suffering from a
toxic condition of the blood which originally
produced the melancholia. This toxin, or
poison, is resisted by the nervous system when
it is well nourished, but has a greater effect
when the nervous system is poorly nourished.
He says that there is a general consensus of
opinion that, during sleep, the blood vessels of
the brain are contracted slightly so that the
amount of blood going into the brain during
sleep is less than during the waking hours.
This was proved many years ago by Professor
Mosso of Turin, by a series of experiments
which are conclusive. When blood vessels are
contracted, and less blood is going to an organ,
the nutrition of that organ is less actively maintained.
Hence, if a person has poison in the
system, it is less restricted during sleep, has
a greater opportunity to attack the nerve-cells,
and thus to prevent the nutrition which is es<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>161</span>sential
to the feeling of general comfort. That
is the theory on which we physicians explain
depression on awaking after sleep in melancholia.
What is true of melancholia is probably
true also of fatigue conditions and irregular
conditions of health, many of which are dependent
upon the existence in the blood of substances
detrimental to health, either the products
of indigestion or the poisons of disease.
This theory explains the conditions in which
a person not actively ill may awake from a sleep
in a state of depression. (See Appendix A.)</p>

<p>Prof. Edward M. Weyer in reading the
sheets of this book suggests another tentative
explanation of depression upon waking: if we
consider the nerve cell as stored with energy,
then, if the store is maintained at normal, it is
in a healthful state. The supply fluctuates
somewhat during the day, but in the melancholic
person it does not rise to normal even
after good sleep: the less amount of carbonic
acid gas eliminated during sleep leaves the
system on waking at the mercy of that poisoned
gas and of the chronically low nervous energy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Many</span>  persons lose sleep because of their
love for others, as the lover who sighs and
tosses, dreaming, asleep or awake, of the beloved.
The mother loses sleep thinking of the
child with its little worries and problems, its
willfulness or its frail health. There is always
some cause that seems to her reasonable ground
for worry. The father, too, plans for the future
of his son, and lies awake to map out a
life for another human being, as if that being
were a puppet and his father held the strings
by which it could be moved in his hands.</p>

<p>Dickens showed the futility of such planning
in “Dombey and Son,” and we have all seen
it in actual life. Yet we go on doing as our fathers
did, and suffering, as we say, “because
of our love.” It is really only because we do
not understand what love is.</p>

<p>What we usually call love is largely self-love;
that is why we hear so much of the pangs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>163</span>
love. Love, being the essence of godlikeness,
ought to bring us the joy of the gods, and love
would bring only joy if we could forget ourselves.
We understand ourselves so little that
we do not know when our love is self-love. We
are always seeking some return upon our affection,
as if it were an investment that must pay
dividends to prove its profitableness. The price
of our love is generally the right to criticise,
to influence, to control; or, if we forego these
seeming advantages, we expect at least consideration
from those whom we have blessed with
our love. No relation of life seems too sacred
to escape the contamination of the selfish demands
of self or narrow love.</p>

<p>The mother loves her child, cares for it in
its helpless years, gladly risks even her life for
it, and yet may be unwilling that that child shall
live its own life, follow its own yearnings, think
its own thoughts. The great stumbling-block
of the parent is the unconscious demand for
gratitude, the claim made upon the child of a
return for the effort and affection so freely bestowed.
It may be that the parent does not look
for material returns, such as money or position,
nevertheless a price is exacted every time
that the parent is surprised, disappointed, or
angered by the child pursuing some course contrary
to his teaching. The love that cared for
the helpless child becomes the tyranny that
would control its thoughts and action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>164</span></p>

<p>We say “This is natural,” but we seldom
say, even to ourselves, “This is selfishness.” We would not desire to compel another to think
as we think, if we were not sure that we could
not be mistaken. It is a conceit of ourselves
which makes us quick to thrust upon another
“ready-made” opinions because they are our
opinions.</p>

<p>But there is a still more subtle selfishness
than this that may be at the bottom of things.
If we have earnestly advocated anything which
the world has been slow to accept, we feel that
it is a sort of attack upon us and our views
when our children do not support those views.
We say, “How can we expect others to heed
us, if our own children don’t heed us,” and so
we are hurt or angered. We think of their
opposition as disloyalty, and it does not occur
to us that it might be no advantage if others
did heed us; that the very opposition of our
children may be the best means of preventing
us from doing harm to our fellows.</p>

<p>Besides, if we cared more that men should
see the right and love it, than that they should
heed us, it would not hurt or vex us whether
they listened or not. If we have a message,
it will find hearers and followers. “There can
never be one lost good,” says Browning, and, if
what we would teach is good, it will find its own.
It is self-love, not love for others, which makes
us sore or angry when they will not listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>165</span></p>

<p>It is a narrow love that makes us fail our
friends because they have not fulfilled the ideal
we had of them. We never really loved them.
We loved something that we thought they
should be, and were unwilling to find them
something different. We get pain out of our
relations with our fellow-beings because our
love is not big enough to exclude self.</p>

<p>We make in our minds a model of what our
friends should be, and it takes up so much room
that we cannot accommodate so much as a mental
photograph of what they really are. And
just there lies not only the possibility but the
absolute assurance of “disappointment” in
them, and consequent “pain” for ourselves.</p>

<p>If we knew our friends for what they really
are, and were willing that they should be themselves,
we could not possibly be disappointed
in them. We really insist upon our friends being
in “our own image and likeness.” Just
so the Hebrews, in the efforts to present God to
the world, made of him simply a man like themselves—big
and strong, to be sure, with sentiments
of love and pity and justice, but with a
lust of anger and revenge which almost blotted
out his tenderness. Many people still cling to
this idea of God, but they are mostly those
whose love is so full of self that even the Supreme
Being must conform to their standard
or they cease to believe in him.</p>

<p>The “disappointment” that so often follows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>166</span>
marriage, even between the fondest lovers, is
mainly caused by this narrow or self-love.
Most married misery is due to each trying to
improve the other instead of himself. “Because
I love him,” says the wife, “he should
do as I ask him, but he refuses. He does not
love me as I love him. I am almost broken-hearted
with disappointment.”
“Any wife who loved her husband would
find it a pleasure to be and to do what he asks.
My wife does not conform to my wishes, but
insists upon doing as she herself prefers. If
a man is not the head of his own house, how is
happiness possible? Marriage is indeed a lottery,
and I have drawn a blank,” says he.</p>

<p>But there is one thing certain, if we find ourselves
suffering through our love in any relation
of life, whether as husband or wife, mother,
daughter, lover, friend, we may be sure that
it is because our love is not broad enough; because
we believe in ownership, or desire gratitude,
or are confident of our wisdom and ability
to control the life of another. In short, that
we love self best. “Love suffereth long and is
kind; ... seeketh not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinketh no evil.” The largest love
embraces, understands, and forgives everything,
and knows no disappointments and no end.</p>

<small>THE SPECTER OF DEATH</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Often</span>  we are anxious and sleepless only
because we are afraid of what is not in
itself frightful. Like the little child in the picture
who mounts the dark stairs in deadly terror
of an imaginary bear, we are afraid lest we
should see a vague something that might terrify
us still more.</p>

<p>But perhaps there is a real specter in our
path? Let us attack the most terrible foe; having
overcome him, we shall find that the lesser
ones have no power over us.</p>

<p>A man was once walking alone a lonely road
on a dark, misty night, fearing every sound
and looking for danger. He had been told that
the road was haunted and this was the terror
that possessed him. As he neared the haunted
spot, he saw a white form rise from the earth.
It was barely discernible through the mist as
it waved thin arms and made soft moaning
sighs. His hair rose on his head, but his going
forward was imperative, so he took heart of
grace, and determined to face his adversary.</p>

<p>“Spirit or human,” said he, “I shall settle
you before I leave this place to-night.” With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>168</span>
this he dashed forward, and found that it was
merely a slender birch with white under-leaves
upturned in the wind, as the breeze sighed
through its branches.</p>

<p>The rest of the road held no terrors for him.
The specter he had most dreaded proved to be
nothing at all. In conquering his first emotion
of fear he had vanquished all terror.</p>

<p>Maybe we fear the possible death either of
ourselves or of some other dearer than ourselves.
Are we afraid of that? Let us look
calmly at it. Changes have taken place, and
are even now in progress in our bodies, yet we
do not fear them. For the most part we are
even unconscious of them: a change is not terrible
in itself, no matter how great it is. Death
is but another change, one that has not yet
come.</p>

<p>A pious man once appealed in distress to the
late Rev. Dr. John Hall: he said he knew his
soul was saved, but he was afraid of dying. Dr.
Hall asked him, “But you are not dying now,
are you?”
“No,” he said, “but I know that I must die
some day.”
“Ah, well!” replied the doctor, “we hardly
need dying grace until our dying day.”
“As our day so shall our strength be”—the
bravest soldier may be nervous contemplating
the battle, but in the action he finds not only
courage but exhilaration. So, if we learn to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>169</span>
live from day to day, we may well put off fear
of death or dying until our dying day has come,
and then we may find that there is nothing to
fear. For the present, what we have to consider
is life, and what it may mean.</p>

<p>There are two ways of looking at life: one
regards life as the changes that take place in
the body from birth to death. The body is always
changing, being almost all renewed at
least every seven years. Old hair is constantly
falling out, to be replaced by new; we cut the
excess growth of the nails, and rarely stop to
think that the nails we have to-day are not the
same nails we had a few weeks or months ago.
We get rid of dead skin, and our skin constantly
renews itself, and so we feel no worry
if we cut or scratch it. We say quite complacently,
“Oh! it will heal up and new skin
grow.” The whole body fades and is renewed.
It is not, then, the changes in the body that we
fear.</p>

<p>We accept this series of physical changes as
physical life, for we know that, if the changes
stopped, life would stop also; but we must also
recognize them as death, for the beginning of
each new stage is the death of the previous
stage. Thus death is steadily going on in ourselves,
at the same time that life continues, and
we not only have no fear of it, but are unconscious
of the process: our body is constantly
passing from death to life, as well as from life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>170</span>
to death, and we are not afraid of that; in fact,
we never give a thought to it.</p>

<p>Even from the physical standpoint man need
not spend his best years fearing death. When
we live so that death shall round out a long
life, we shall have lost all fear of it. When
we say that a person did not die a “natural
death” we usually mean that he died suddenly
and violently. But death from disease is not
“natural” either, and in as far as we learn
how to live aright, harmonizing the physical,
mental, and spiritual natures, realizing that the
perishing body is not all of us, we can avoid
most of the fruitful sources of disease. As we
learn what true life is, and how natural the
eventual dissolution of the body is, we shall
cease to tremble at it.</p>

<p>Metchnikoff, the eminent philosopher and
student who has devoted years of study and
research to the life and death of man, says:
“When diseases are suppressed, and the course
of life regulated by scientific hygiene, it is probable
that death will come only at extreme old
age. When death comes in its natural place at
the end of the normal cycle of the physical life,
it will be robbed of its terrors, and be accepted
gratefully as any other part of the cycle of
life.”
He thinks, in fact, that the instinct of life
may be replaced by an instinct of death. “It
is even possible,” he says, “that the approac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>171</span>h
of natural death is one of the most pleasant
sensations in the world.” Perhaps the most
striking evidence of the truth of this so far
recorded is the case of Brillat-Savarin’s aunt—who,
at ninety-three, said to her famous
nephew, “If you ever reach my age you will
find that one wants to die just as one wants to
sleep.”
All of us know of cases where the very aged,
having lived their lives to the best of their
perceptions, awaited death willingly and almost
joyfully. As Browning says, “Thou waitedst
age; wait death, nor be afraid.”
Fear of the approach of death disturbs us
because we feel further possibilities of life. We
do not want to be cut off in the flower of our
existence; we think of death, not as a change of
existence, but as the end of it, and we think
there is no sure way of avoiding that. All of
us have felt the truth of Dickens’ idea of the
bells which toll almost gladly for the aged, but
seem to weep when the young die. We are sure
we should not fear death, nor be unwilling to
die if we had the privilege of living to a “ripe
old age.” For time is not measured by the
clock or by the calendar; those measure only
the revolutions of the earth and of the sun.
Time is measured by thought and act, and, more
than all, by feeling. And we can ordinarily
prolong our own lives to the time when we shall
willingly and gladly lay them down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>172</span></p>

<p>This willingness is by no means the same
feeling that prompts the useless and unmeaning
exclamation, “Oh, I wish I were dead!” The
average person gets into such an unreasoning
state over every little happening that he cannot
see any connection between the events in
his daily life. He becomes discouraged, and
thinks for the moment that he would like to
quit it all. No matter how many years such an
one has lived, he has not attained a “ripe old
age.” Ripeness has no part in petty impatience;
it implies mellowness, soundness, and
general wholesomeness of character.</p>

<p>As man is learning more and more about his
life, he is finding that sickness, premature old
age, and untimely death are, in a large measure,
due to his own misunderstanding of the
purposes of life. It is this misunderstanding
that gives the mysterious air to life. We fear
the mysterious, for our ingrained habit of regarding
things that we do not yet understand as
insoluble mysteries is a relic of the days when
savage man found mystery and danger in
everything.</p>

<p>So, if we are making ourselves unhappy, losing
sleep, and suffering physical and mental
distress because of the possible approach of
death, we may dismiss that cause of worry. As
soon as we begin to consider the purposes of
life and our relation to them, we shall naturally
avoid excesses in eating; live as hy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>173</span>gienically
as possible; harbor cleanly, uplifting
thoughts, helpful to others and to ourselves, and
so reach out spiritually for a fuller understanding
of the purposes of all life. And what we
cease to fear for ourselves, we soon cease to
fear for our other selves.</p>

<p>Living thus, we shall not fear death, but shall
move toward it without thinking of it, knowing
that it is natural, merely the long sleep of
the objective consciousness.</p>

<small>A NATURAL CHANGE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Through</span>  generations, perhaps for hundreds
of thousands of years, custom has
ordained grief for the dead, we have come to
feel that it is a proof of affection or of sensitiveness
or a sort of virtue: we indulge in the
luxury of woe, we nurse our grief until, like a
spoiled lap-dog, it becomes a burden. But we
know that the unselfish dead would only be distressed
at our grieving.</p>

<p>When we look upon the change called death
as no more mysterious than any of the other
changes in our bodily or mental development,
which we either welcome or are unconscious of,
we shall lose our terror of it either for ourselves
or for others.</p>

<p>Our terror for others is not really for those
others so much as for ourselves. The sense
of “our great loss” is really a piece of selfishness.
For life cannot mean one thing for us
and another for our brother; as we see our
own lives, so must we see the lives of those we
love. The purposes of life are the same for
all men, for all men are in the plan of the
Spirit.</p>

<p>If for any reason our brother has passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>176</span>
from our earthly cognizance, we cannot say
that we have really lost him. It is true that we
do not see him with our eyes or touch him with
our hands, but we have a remembrance of him
in the form of a mental picture down to the
minutest details of how he looked and moved,
and we also have a remembrance of his spiritual
character.</p>

<p>For the character—that sum of the abilities
of those we love—remains with us after the
physical form has passed away. We are affected
by it just as we were when the loved one
lived. We can feel the appeal that that character
makes to us, its effect upon our thoughts
and actions, as strongly as if the absent one
stood beside us and claimed our attention.
How, then, can we say he is lost?</p>

<p>The dead whom we have loved hold us as
securely as they did when they were living; it
is only that we do not see how. It has come
within the experience of many that the death
of father, mother, or some dearly loved one has
led to the awakening of some wayward or misguided
one who seemed to be wasting all the
opportunities of life. We know that it was not
the mere death which worked this seeming
miracle. That simply woke the dormant love in
the one who had hitherto desired only his own
way. As soon as he became conscious of his
love for the beloved one who has passed out of
his earthly life, he longed to be what his be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>177</span>loved
would have had him be, and so he turned
his attention to using the opportunities of life,
to the end that he might grow and develop.
Thus in death the loved one held the wayward
friend even more securely than he ever
had in life.</p>

<p>We shall not fear death, even for those we
love, when we have realized that it is but a
passing from life to life—just as the falling
leaves do not mean the annihilation of the life
of the tree, but merely the end of one phase
of that life. Somewhere, some time, that which
was really our loved one will blossom again in
the world’s experience, and even now is continuing
to live through its influence upon our
lives. “There is no death; what seems so is
transition.”
The bodily companionship with all that it
implies, that we have lost: yet, if our beloved
had gone to be Viceroy of India, we should miss
him, but we should not put on mourning for
that, nor “grieve” that we had lost his companionship.</p>

<p>“But we could write and hear from him and
so keep in touch with him.” True: it is then
for your own loss that you mourn.</p>

<p>Nearly all the suffering that death causes us
is for ourselves. It is our feeling of helplessness,
the emptiness of the earth that is left,
the changed world that we look at in the sleepless
hours of the night, or, when we awake in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>178</span>
the morning, our pity for our own loss and the
seeming uselessness of what remains of our existence.
This consciousness of our loss numbs
us so that we cannot get a realizing sense of
the joys of the spirit set free from the limitations
of the body. Our love is still so earthy
that it demands fleshly as well as spiritual
communion.</p>

<p>So real is our suffering when those we love
best are torn from us that for a time we are
inconsolable. Philosophy, religion, the affectionate
ministrations of those about us, avail
not to bind up the broken heart. There is but
one cure for such grief—to minister to others.
Unselfish devotion to a great cause—the cause
of our fellows, whether in the mass or individually—is
a sovereign balm for a bleeding heart.</p>

<p>When we understand life we know this, for
we have learned that neither in joy nor in sorrow
can any man live to himself. Action of any
sort relieves tension and suffering. If we bottle
up all our sympathy for ourselves, it becomes
so tainted with selfishness and narrowness that
it loses its healing qualities. But if we let that
sympathy go out freely to others, forgetting
our “personal” needs, it blesses them and
blesses us.</p>

<p>A friend of mine lost a son and daughter by
drowning, just as they had entered young manhood
and womanhood, and for a time his grief
threatened to crush him. He found no relief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>179</span>
until he had his attention called to the sorrow
of another who, through a train wreck, had
lost his only child. Although a stranger to this
stricken father, he sought him out and, because
of his own double loss, was able to comfort him
as no one else could. Moreover, the restlessness
went out of his own heart; he realized his
kinship with all sufferers as never before.</p>

<p>There is a story in “The Light of Asia” that Buddha, to comfort a mother broken-hearted
over the death of her only child, sent
her to get black mustard seed from a house
where death had never been. The mother carried
her dead babe about the village, and in each
house she was offered mustard seed, but each
giver said, “Death has been here.” At last
she realized that she was not the only sufferer,
that death was a necessary accompaniment of
life as shadow is a necessary accompaniment
of light. Her grief, she saw, was but a part of
the common sorrow. The recognition that
either joy or sorrow is common to all increases
the healing sense of unity, it is a “touch of
nature” that “makes the whole world kin.”
There is no wrong in our grieving, if it comforts
us: but to look thus each for himself dispassionately
at the cause and the nature of his
grief, will surely give so clear a view of it that
it will no longer deprive us of sleep.</p>

<p>Then why lose sleep worrying about what we
know to be merely a change?</p>

<small>THE DISTRUST OF LIFE</small></h2></div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span>  there is no cause to fear death, even when
one views life as purely physical, there is
still less cause to fear it when one holds the
second possible view of what life is—the view
that life is the Unseen Consciousness and is
within one’s self. These are two opposing
views; it is only when we try to combine them
that we find ourselves filled with fears. When
we reason about our bodily life, thinking of
ourselves as animals, and apply the conclusions
to our lives as men, we find confusion, uncertainty,
and fear: for our minds reach conclusions
that our hearts tell us cannot be true.</p>

<p>What man fears is not death—<i class="em">as an animal</i>
he does not know or see death. As long as a
man is mainly animal he suffers only as an animal.
The deer that flees before the dogs is
not afraid of death, for it is not possible that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>181</span>
it could conceive of death: that is possible only
to the reflecting and comparing mind. He fears
the suffering that must follow from an attack
from creatures of superior strength and fierce
appetites. So man fears that his animal existence,
which he does know,—with all its
changes,—may be painfully cut off. As a rational
being, man knows that death is only a
natural and never-ending change. He knows
that life is only that which he recognizes as
humanness in himself when he meditates upon
it. He says to himself, “I feel my life, not
as I have been or as I shall be, but I feel it
thus: that I am, that I never began anywhere,
that I shall never end anywhere.” According
to this view, death does not exist.</p>

<p>His animal view of life, as the changes in his
body, differs so much from the spiritual view
of life as Unseen Consciousness, that he cannot
reconcile them. They lead to “warring in
his members,” a conflict between the limitations
of the mind and the intuitions of the soul.
This causes fear.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a merely physical shrinking
from death, the result of race inheritance.
In the early days of our race, before man had
learned to control the forces of material life,
those men or races of men that did not love
life, feared death and avoided it, made less effort,
and took less care of their lives, and, accordingly,
soon ceased to exist. Only the hardy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>182</span>
survived. The fear of death helped to preserve
the race.</p>

<p>But this inherited shrinking from death is
not what tortures man. What causes the uneasiness
is rather that superstitious fear of
death, which is really fear of a life after the
throes of death. We have made this present
life so unreasonable and so inconsistent with
our own nature that we feel as if any life after
death must be just as incomprehensible and inconsistent
as this one, so we fear it. We fail
to see that all life goes on developing and improving,
and so we think our future life may
be much worse than what we have now; then,
like Hamlet, we ask is it really “better to endure
the ills we have than fly to others that we
know not of?”
Because we hold these two views of life, the
animal’s view and the spirit’s view, we seem
to hear two voices crying in our hearts when
we consider things: the voice of the Body and
the voice of the Soul. The Body says, “I shall
cease to be, I shall die, all that I set my life
in shall die.” The Soul cries, “I am, I cannot
die, I ought not to die,” and, as if from
still deeper depths, comes an appalling whisper,
“Yet I am dying.” (Tolstoy.)</p>

<p>It is because of this contradiction that terror
seizes the mind when we think of the death
of the flesh. Man has so long assumed that his
fleshly life is the same as himself that he can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>183</span>not
easily rid himself of the idea. Yet, if a
man lose a hand or an arm or a leg by accident,
he does not think that part of his consciousness
or self is gone. He knows that a part of his
body—through which himself is made manifest
to other men—is gone, but he does not for a
moment think that he, the human being, is any
less. And he is not.</p>

<p>It is true that the automatic processes of his
mind refuse for some time to accept the loss
of the members of his body, he misses that way
of expressing his will. But that is not so
strange as it may at first seem. All voluntary
motion arises from desire, and is sent out from
the directing mind by means of the nerves to
the part of the body fitted to perform that
motion. We are not conscious of sending
an order to any nerve center when we wish to
put one foot before the other in walking or to
use our fingers in writing.</p>

<p>Yet such an order is given, and the desire
and the nerve center have both learned from repeated
experiences just how properly to direct
that message to the foot or to the tips of
the fingers. If, for any reason, we miscalculate,
we find ourselves walking haltingly or
stumblingly along; or our fingers do not move
the pencil fairly so as to get the right results.
So, too, when we have lost a foot or a hand, the
nerve centers send out their messages with
the same force as before, but the messages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>184</span>
find no way of being delivered. But at no
time does a man think that he is less
himself because of the missing member. For
myself and my body are not one and the
same. <i class="em">Myself</i> is that which lives in my
body, and neither that body nor the years it exists
in any way determine the life of myself.
This self of mine, which thinks and feels, is
older than recorded time; why, then, should we
think that it will end with the century? It
would not be possible, within the few years that
the body exists, for the intelligence or consciousness
of the individual to begin at nothingness
and attain the degree of development of a
human being.</p>

<p>This self or consciousness is really the outcome
of the impressions, experiences, and conclusions
of my ancestors for thousands upon
thousands of years back, and this self began
to be shaped even by that from which man
sprang. It is continuous; just as it began before
my body was formed, so it must go on after
the body ceases to exist; it cannot be a mere
part of the body which will change with it or
end with it.</p>

<p>We do not know, as yet, how we shall continue
to live after the body is laid away:
whether in the thoughts and feelings and deeds
we have done in the flesh; or in our unending,
though unconscious, influence; or in the lives
of the children of our bodies or of our minds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>185</span>
and hearts. But we do know that the world
will never be the same as if we had never been
here. We do know that what has existed
through unnumbered ages will not end in this.</p>

<p>Life does not cease with sleep nor end with
death. “I never was not,” says the Bhagavad
Gita, “nor shall I hereafter cease to be.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span>  of the main purposes of sleep is to secure
rest to men. But intelligence will
find rest in many other ways independent of
sleep or of promoting sleep. We are just beginning,
under the leadership of such people as
Miss Eva Vescelius, to make a full use of music
as a soother of the nerves: yet, as long ago as
the time of David, some persons knew its value.
Browning’s magnificent poem, “Saul,” recounts its force.</p>

<p>As David exorcised Saul’s evil spirit by the
skillful harp and voice, so those who are studying
the therapeutics of music are now helping
the physically and mentally ill. Miss Vescelius
and those working with her claim that “music
is capable of great life-awakening energy....
The use of music for healing the sick is therefore
a natural use of a natural power. Music,
like medicine, has been divided into classes as
stimulants, sedatives, and narcotics. It is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>187</span>
admitted that music can be so employed as to
exercise a distinct psychological influence upon
the mind, the nerve centers and the circulatory
system, and that by the intelligent use of music
many ills may be cured.”
For almost all of us “music hath charms
to soothe.” Others again find in some form of
massage a sweet though artificial sedative;
some even in the combing of the hair, which is
possibly connected with an electric effect, for
we know little definitely as yet of the principles
of the possible curative force of electricity.</p>

<p>Others again rest by a mere mental change
in their ordinary avocations. My wife was once
talking with Mr. Stiegler, a well-known riding
teacher in New York, and he said that he was in
the saddle every day from six or seven in the
morning till eleven at night, with only short
intervals for meals. “It’s a hard life,” he
said.</p>

<p>“But Sundays?” the lady asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sundays! I have Sundays to myself.”
“And what do you do on Sundays?”
“Oh!” he said, “I take a ride in the
Park.”
The relief from the strain of watching the
pupils and their horses was rest to him.</p>

<p>When Weston had won his first six days’
walk in Madison Square Garden, he went out
to take a walk on Fifth Avenue on the Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>188</span></p>

<p>To find harmony with our own natures, to
act in accordance with our natural or acquired
tendencies, is rest. A peaceful surrounding is
rest in itself, though sleep may not be wooed.
One may be rested by a walk in a country lane,
when a walk in the bustle of Broadway would
only tire him the more.</p>

<p>And this peaceful surrounding may be interior
just as well as exterior. Mrs. Elizabeth
Burns Ferm, who has a playhouse for children
on the East Side in New York, and does a great
deal of other work, recently said: “I could
never accomplish what I do if I did not sleep
so well. That rests me completely. I do not
dream nor stir. I drop into the homogeneous,
forgetting myself and becoming just a part of
life. In this way I rest.”
The oldest books show that, ever since there
have been any records of man, he has been
seeking happiness and rest, yet he has not attained
either happiness or rest. But the seeking
has helped in his growth upward and progress
has been his reward. As Browning
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Progress is man’s distinguishing mark alone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Not God’s; not the beasts’: He is; they are;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man partly is and wholly hopes to be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even though man seeks in wrong directions,
he is sure to move onward so long as he continues
to seek, for, if we sufficiently desire any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>189</span>
goal, we shall eventually find it. “What d’ye
lack? quoth God,” says Emerson, “take it
and pay the price.” Jesus put the same thing
in another form. Said he, “Ask and it shall
be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and
it shall be opened unto you.”
Those who misunderstand life and its purposes
apply this only to what are called religious
matters, but those who see farther into
life know that it applies in every way. It all
depends upon what we feel that we lack. If we
feel we lack pleasure, or happiness, or rest, we
seek them along the lines we think they may be
found. And we pay the price that is asked. We
cannot avoid this so long as cause and effect
follow each other.</p>

<p>If we seek happiness through selfish gratifications,
we pay the price of disappointment and
pain, if we are at all enlightened. Of course, if
a man lives the life of the animal merely, cutting
himself off from any recognition of the
claims of his fellows, he may get all the happiness
he can understand through self-seeking.
But the price he pays is that he is not able to
understand or to appreciate more than this
lesser happiness. As Walter Scott says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For him no minstrel raptures swell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proud though his title, high his fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Despite those titles, power and pelf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wretch, concentered all in self,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>190</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Living shall forfeit fair renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, doubly dying, shall go down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the vile dust from whence he sprung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the price he pays.</p>

<p>If we seek happiness through the happiness
of all; if we forget self, understanding that all
are One, seeking that wisdom which comes only
from seeing all life as one, we, in like measure,
get the reward.</p>

<p>Men, mere animal men, who understand nothing
but self-seeking, may speak evil of us, they
probably will, but even that cannot “hurt” us.
We shall understand that such evil speaking is
the best they know, and that, therefore, it is
not evil to their minds. Moreover, the further
premium to us will be a broader understanding,
a deepening love, an increase of happiness, an
influx of peace, a pervading sense of rest, and
quiet sleep.</p>

<p>This is a premium most of us would be willing
to work for, did we but see it. And we may
see it if we will. If we ask of life that we get
into harmony with its purposes; if we seek diligently
even into our own hearts for those purposes;
if we knock at the door of man’s full life,
we shall find our asking answered, our search
rewarded, and the door wide open. What a man
desireth most, that, somehow, somewhere, shall
be gain. Desire creates function.</p>

<p>And, when the soul has gained what it sought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>191</span>
we shall find beauties and virtues hitherto unsuspected
in every human being; we shall learn
that, above the turmoil and noise of our rushing,
jarring, modern civilization, we can hear
the morning stars sing together for joy, the
music of the spheres, that which shall yet soothe
man’s fear and teach him to find restful sleep.</p>

<small>THE NEED OF REST</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">The bliss of an unbroken sleep.<br />

<span class="smcap">Thos. W. Parsons.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To</span>  go in the wrong direction delays our journey
and brings fatigue, but that fatigue
may teach us needed lessons.</p>

<p>Man seeks happiness through outer things,
hoping to find it in wealth, excitement, travel,
self-gratification, and in countless other ways
that the age-long experience of men have
proved to be ineffectual; but he usually forgets
that the wellspring of happiness is within.
Long before Solomon had announced that “this
also is vanity and vexation of spirit,” men had
observed that riches do not bring happiness;
that excitement wearies us, that travel is unsatisfying,
and that gratification of the senses
ends in exhaustion.</p>

<p>At last, in despair of satisfaction in the
world, we have accepted the teaching that there
is no rest on this side of the grave. We have
even learned to glorify strain and the strenuous
life as natural and desirable. At best, men
have thought of rest as something that con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>193</span>cerned
the body, and have confounded it with
sleep and inaction.</p>

<p>If we think we have important work to do,
we say, “We have no time to rest,” as if any
work would be laid upon us that ought to prevent
us having rest. Draught horses have been
bred for centuries for the sole purpose of work,
yet a wise driver never overloads nor overworks
his horse. He sees that it is comfortably
housed, well fed, and has its needed rest. Shall
we think that the Spirit of Life has less consideration
for man than man has for the horse?
That were in effect to say that man were
greater and wiser than that which caused man,
and which man has spent the ages trying to
understand.</p>

<p>When we stop to think of this we can see how
foolish it is, but we seldom stop to think until
something “happens” that stops us. We go
on from day to day thinking that we have no
time to rest. This state of mind, which leads
to trouble, is possible only because we do not
understand what rest is, nor how easy it is to
have it. We ordinarily seek rest only after we
have become exhausted.</p>

<p>When we have wearied ourselves with worry,
useless exertion, and fretting, or with envy,
hatred, or malice; when we have bent all our
energies to some low aim or selfish purpose;
when we have broken nearly all of Nature’s
laws and are called upon to pay the penalty, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>194</span>
seek a physician. A man sets a shifting standard
of wealth as his goal, and strains to attain
it; he eats improperly and in great haste, his
thoughts filled with the problems of the market;
he is forever on the alert for any advantage
that he may take of his fellows; he cannot endure
to have another reap an advantage that
is denied him; he is envious of every bit of
success that, passing him by, goes to another;
he makes of his life one fierce round of money-getting.
Then, perhaps before attaining his
goal, perhaps after reaching it, he discovers
himself a physical wreck, and hastens to his
physician, seeking external means to cure that
which has its root in internal conditions; asking
the man of drugs to “minister to a mind
diseased.”
To the nervous, worried, hurried person,
from whatever cause, the physician’s advice is
generally the same—“Take a complete rest,” meaning thereby that all work be given up and
inaction take the place of activity. When circumstances
allow it, we try to follow this advice,
but it usually results in boredom and impatience
at the lost time; when circumstances
do not allow the inactivity, we get discouraged
and complain of life as a series of mysterious,
unjust happenings. The physician’s advice
proves a mockery and we become listless and
discouraged.</p>

<p>We hardly ever seek our rest from moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>195</span>
to moment; for we continue to look upon it as
something we shall find after our work is done.
The laborer, the merchant, and the professional
man think of the end of the day as resting-time,
just as the busy housewife does. It matters
not how much we may love our work, we expect
to be exhausted by our efforts before the day
is over. We feel hurried, anxious, fretted, and
overworked all day long, and comfort ourselves
with the prospect of rest at night. And all the
time we might rest and never find the day so
short as to cause worry, nor the hours so long
nor the work so hard as to tire us.</p>

<p>It is only when we are burdened with distracting
cares that we get tired by what is a joy
to us. The true artist wants no eight-hour day;
he laments only that daylight fades so soon.
When we are doing only what we love to do, and
doing it well, we run and are not weary, we walk
and do not faint.</p>

<p>Of late years the trainers of athletes have
recognized this—they think it more important
to keep the men buoyant and fresh than to increase
the muscles at the risk of bringing them
“stale” to the day of contest. They insist
that the men shall not exhaust themselves at
any time before the race.</p>

<p>Exhaustion shows either that we have been
doing the wrong thing or doing it wrong, and
kindly Nature reproves us with the loss of
Sleep.</p>

<small>SAVING OF EFFORT</small></h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>  unsatisfied longing for rest in all mankind
will be attributed to different causes
according to the way we look at life. The
physical or animal man desires rest because
of the relief it will bring to nerves and muscles
wearied by the strain of activities; he feels that
to relax will bring him some ease and that
relaxation will help him to forget the bodily
weariness. Recovering from weariness or pain
is a pleasure in itself. The sigh of relief is
really a sigh of pleasure.</p>

<p>When the mind reigns, it instinctively recognizes
that rest would restore the balance disturbed
by feverish exertions. Our whole lives
seem passed in a struggle to attain something,
and the law of rhythm, which is the law of
action and reaction, requires that, after struggle,
effort should cease. One implies the other;
neither effort nor true rest can continue stead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>197</span>ily.
Effort is the breaking of rest; shadow is
only the relative absence of light.</p>

<p>It is contrast that makes sensations; the
shadow serves to make the light brighter; the
night makes the day more fair; and noon makes
the night darker. Tennyson recognized this in
the line, “Sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering
happier things.” He might have said,
with equal truth, that the present joy has a
warmer flush because of forgotten pain.</p>

<p>Wagner understood that, and so we find crash
and seeming inharmony so often a prelude to
the softest, tenderest strains. The mind first
wearies of monotony, even of harmony, and
then ceases to be able to perceive it. Wagner
saw this, and introduced clashing sound that
seems like discord until we feel its connection
with the emotion and the context of the piece.
These relieve the emotions and throw the harmonies
into relief. Says Hobbes: to have one
sensation and to have it continually would be
to have none.</p>

<p>The mental man feels and knows all this, and
to him rest becomes necessary to restore that
balance of things that contrast suggests—rest
after effort, peace after turmoil.</p>

<p>The spiritual man goes still deeper into true
conditions in his longing for rest. Rest carries
with it the idea of attainment. He who has
attained has peace: “Peace I leave with you;
my peace I give unto you.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>198</span>
The unity of all three desires—that of the
body, that of the mind, and that of the spirit—cannot
fail to strike the thinker. To cease to
strain is the keynote of ease. Why? Because
man sees, however dimly, that agonizing, like
antagonizing, is really futile, and that the only
thing that is necessary is to put one’s self in
harmony with the Universe.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer has shown that grace of
movement consists in the economy of effort, in
doing every act with the least possible waste
of power. The same thought is the basis of the
teaching of the great Delsarte. As Ruskin
says: “Is not the evidence of ease on the very
front of all the greatest works in existence?
Do they not say plainly to us, not ‘there has
been a great effort here,’ but ‘there has been
a great power here’? It is not the weariness of
mortality, but the strength of divinity, which
we have to recognize in all things; and this is
just what we now never recognize, but think
that we shall do great things by the help of iron
bars and perspiration. Alas! we shall do nothing
that way, but lose some pounds of our own
weight.”
The best way to attain anything is to move
towards it with the least possible jarring or
friction. In every struggle we lose force, because
we are sure to make unnecessary motions.
Men do not learn this from their daily work as
unconsciously as they once did, because ma<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>199</span>chinery
has so largely displaced handwork.
But, even in using machinery, he is the best
workman who has learned to run his machine
and get good results with the least expenditure
of physical effort. Such a workman remains
fresh for a longer period, and accomplishes
more in a given time. The machine itself is
constructed upon the principle of saving effort—it
cuts out all unnecessary motion and reduces
friction as much as possible.</p>

<p>If you watch a skilled typesetter at his case,
you will find that apparently he is never in a
rush. The beginner, especially if he is one of
the more nervous type, looks anxious, pauses
with hand fluttering above the case while he
considers in which box he will find the letter he
seeks; then, when he has made a decision, he
will pounce upon it and deposit it in the stick
with breathless haste. Not so the seasoned
compositor. There is no haste, no fluttering,
no waste motion. His hand goes unerringly to
the box where he will find the letter he wants,
in a twinkling it is in place in the stick, and
another letter disposed of in the same way, and
you are scarcely conscious of motion. The perfect
workman is he who has learned to accomplish
most with the least expenditure of effort.
It is toward this perfection that Frederick W.
Taylor and others are striving in the new
“Business Efficiency.”
Every day we are surprised to learn that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>200</span>
what <i class="em">we</i> gained by hard struggle has been
gained with scarcely an effort by another. It
does not always make us happy to learn it. We
often feel as if we had been tricked, and we
think that effort spent in what we now see was
not the most effective way, was wasted. This
leads us sometimes to persist in a mistaken
course, because we are unwilling to believe that
we have lost so much time and missed so much
result. But no effort is ever wasted: it is only
by the effort to do well that we can learn to do
better.</p>

<p>Nothing is commoner than to hear our friends
say, “I don’t sleep—the work is so hard and
exacting I get dead tired and then toss about
all night.” But it is not the work, rather it is
the worker that is exacting.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Though</span>  you want rest, peace, sleep—the
opposites of strife—yet people will oppose
you and want you to go their impossible
ways. That need not arouse opposition, nor
break your rest, nor disturb the even tenor of
your way. One disadvantage of allowing ourselves
to be disturbed is that we cannot be
angry with one person without being angry
with all about us. Or at least the harmony of
our relation is broken, because, despite our effort,
we cannot succeed in separating ourselves
from our brothers. The next time you are
angry or impatient with someone who has opposed
you, take note how it affects your tone
and your feeling toward those who are innocent
of any offense.</p>

<p>One such investigation into our own condition
when annoyed will help to cure us of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>202</span>
being angry; for there is no use in trying to correct
all the mistakes or worrying over the neglects

bodies. Other people, “the same as us,” have
to learn by their mistakes, and often do learn
by some success that we considered manifestly

<p>When Mosenthal was organist at Calvary
Church, the brides used to give him directions
about just what pieces they wanted played at
their weddings; Mosenthal would say, “Ah!
that is a beautiful selection,” or “A magnificent
march!” As he said, “I listen to all the
lovely ladies’ orders—then I play what I think
best—and it always goes all right.” He did
not make rows by trying to convince excited
girls that the “Mikado” would not be just the
thing for the church, or to persuade nice
mammas without musical education that “Traumerei” would not do for a wedding. It was
not necessary to lie, only to give what approval
could be given and then to “gae his ain gait.”
Most people are not really much set in their
own ways, they only seem to be. They have an
idea (or they think they have one—an idea is a
rare and precious possession) and they want to
“get it off.” Let them; why should you make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>203</span>
the explosion dangerous by confining it?
Maybe they were only trying to argue with
themselves, and, having got rid of the idea,
they are content, if their self-love is not roused
in defense of it. Like the codfish which deposits
her eggs and has no more care about
them, they are quite content to leave the results
to Nature.</p>

<p>There was a tract called the “Oiled
Feather,” which was very popular in England
forty years ago. Sam, a wagoner, has a bottle
of oil with a feather stuck in the cork, and,
when a barn-door sticks or harness creaks or a
king-bolt binds, instead of using force, he always
brings out his oil bottle and feather. His
friend has not learned the usefulness of gentle
methods and gets into all sorts of trouble, until
he sees that the Oiled Feather principle applies
to horses and to people and to difficulties,
as well as to things.</p>

<p>“Est modus in rebus”—which means that
“there is a way in things” just as much as in
people: get into key with it and all will go
smoothly. Did you ever try to split trap-rock
with a hammer? You may batter all day at
one side and you will only knock off chips, spoil
your hammer, and hurt your hands: but, when
you have found the right spot, a tap knocks it
in pieces. That tap is the “open sesame” to
which alone the stone will yield. You may
storm at it all day with your “open millet”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>204</span> or “open wheat,” but its heart can be reached
only by its own word. So the stony heart of
the world can be broken only by the Master
Word of Love.</p>

<p>Now, if you have made what is said in Chapter

for you know that, as long as you arouse antagonism
in others, you can be annoyed and irritated

<small>STRUGGLE IN THE FAMILY</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">How happy is that balm to wretches, sleep!<br />

<span class="smcap">Beaumont.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span>  all that we have learned were that some
persons “naturally” work harder than
others to achieve anything, we might say that
this was unavoidable; and there would be a
degree of truth in it. It is true that the intelligence
of some people is so sluggish that they
learn little from experience. They continue to
work towards any end in the same way that
they have always worked, wasting both strength
and time. For them there is nothing but repeated
experiences and patient guidance until
they learn to apply their knowledge practically.</p>

<p>But the intelligent man learns that, often
where he has worked in the hardest possible
way, he has had the most unsatisfactory return
for his effort. The good housekeeper, for instance,
wishes above all things to make her
family comfortable; she has inherited a feeling
of the requirements of healthy living, and decides
that she must have a scrupulously clean
house to protect her loved ones from the dangers
of germs and microbes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>206</span></p>

<p>So she sweeps, scrubs, cleans from morning
until night; carefully removes every trace of
dust, follows her family with dust-pan and
brush, and at least looks reproachfully at the
offender who does not remove every trace of
street or garden dirt from his shoes before entering
the house. She cleans so hard that she
forgets that the real object of cleaning is to
make her family safe and comfortable. They
may be safe, but they are a long way from being
comfortable, and she knows no more comfort
than they; cleanliness has become a fetich
with her, and some day, perhaps, she comes to
her senses, finding herself chasing the motes in
a sunbeam, lest by chance they should rest upon
her sacred furniture.</p>

<p>If she then sits down to take stock of things,
she finds that husband and children almost
dread to come home. However serene and
happy they may be before reaching the garden
gate, or the apartment door, they then become
nervous and distrait. They look themselves
over, to be sure that nothing is amiss, for
“mother is so particular.” An anxious expression
settles upon their faces, for, with their
best endeavors, they may have overlooked
something that mother’s trained and suspicious
eye may note. The joy of life abates, and a
sort of painful hush falls upon things.</p>

<p>The average child cannot see that this condition
grows out of misdirected love and care;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>207</span>
he sees no connection between it and his well-being,
but, if he thinks of it at all, he concludes
that “the house” counts for more with mother
than anything else. Husband and children unconsciously
come to regard her as mainly a
housekeeper, with interests bounded by the four
walls of the home. The very gifts they make
her are of a useful nature—“something for the
house”—as if the “house” were some special
thing in her personal life but meant nothing to
them.</p>

<p>When the hungry heart of this woman pains
her, she resents the condition that she herself
has created, but does not see the correct remedy.
Her husband and children have put her
out of their inner lives; they take their pleasures
away from home, they find their confidantes
among outside friends. Who should
share their thoughts and their pleasures? she
asks. Who has worked day and night for their
comfort and happiness as she has? And the
chances are that she considers them ungrateful
and herself a martyr, when all the time she herself
builds the barrier between them and herself
by striving to make them happy in her way.
That it is not their way, and so could not be
in harmony with the natural trend of things,
does not once occur to her. As the French say,
“Madam costs herself too much.” She has
not learned, and may never learn, that the only
way to make others happy is to love them sin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>208</span>cerely
and unselfishly enough to allow them to
be happy in their own way.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the father who destroys the
joy of home. A many good men think that
their duty is done when they provide food,
clothes, shelter, and education for their children,
and insist upon obedience from them.
They are so busy attending to these things that
they have no time to get acquainted with their
children, to know or be known by them.</p>

<p>There is too much truth in the newspaper
joke on the suburbanite. A mother found her
little boy crying bitterly on the doorstep quite
early on a Monday morning.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Freddie?” she asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Why,” sobbed the child, “I was just running
down the street when the man who stops
here on Sundays spanked me and sent me
home.” There are many children who have no
cause to welcome “the man who stops here on
Sundays,” even though he may be counted “a
good father.” Very often he “takes a nap,” and all noise must cease for his benefit; or, he
cannot read his Sunday paper while they are
playing about. He speaks testily to his wife,
blaming her that she does not quiet the children.
“They have all the week to play,” he
complains, “I should think they could keep
quiet on Sunday. It is the only day I have
to rest, and you ought to see that I am not dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>209</span>turbed.” And the mother, who hasn’t even
Sunday to rest, quiets the children in the only
way she knows, and everybody is wretched.</p>

<p>As fast as the children grow up they leave
home gladly for college or business, and,
though they respect and fear “the Head of the
Family,” they have no real love for him; they
never consult him on their intimate, personal
worries or problems, and he many times carries
a sore heart behind his seemingly stern manner.
He wonders why his children are so ungrateful,
when he has spent his whole life toiling for
them. In his bitter moments he may even call
them monsters of ingratitude; forgetting, as
Dickens says, that he is really looking for
“monsters of gratitude.”
These parents, like everyone else, have it in
their power to attract to themselves the affection
and the surroundings that they need, and
to create a center of repose even in the midst of
strife; rest we may attain even amid turmoil;
but true repose means that quiet shall spread
from us to others.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">But</span>  the harmony of the home does not depend
upon the parents alone. If it did,
it would forever disprove the statement that it
is only by a working together of all parts of
any organization that its real purpose may be
accomplished. A clock is intended to tell the
time, and its mechanism is so constructed that,
by its working together, the hands and chime
will mark the hours. But, if we could imagine
the hands of the clock refusing to move in the
direction that the springs, wheels, and pendulum
required, and insisting upon going their
own way, the usefulness of the clock would be
destroyed.</p>

<p>So, in the matter of family harmony, it may
be merely some self-willed son or daughter,
even a child, that causes the discord. And he
is not necessarily a “bad” child, either. He
may be endowed with special gifts, and be par<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>211</span>ticularly
adapted to give joy to those about
him. He loves his parents, his brothers and
sisters, and also that intangible “home” that
counts for so much in life—yet, because he loves
his “own way” more than all else, he makes
“home” impossible. He is so sure of his
infallible judgment that he opposes every suggestion
that does not come from himself; he
offers free advice on every possible and impossible
occasion; he “takes sides” on every
question that arises, and considers any opposition
as a personal attack or affront. He is not
conscious of these or of any other faults, yet
every remark, every act is tested by its possible
reference to himself. He looms so large in
his own foreground that he cannot see how he
could be unimportant to anybody’s life or
thought. He broods over fancied wrongs and
thinks himself the most ill-used of mortals.
Everybody is unhappy where he is, and he is
most unhappy of all.</p>

<p>For it is a well-established fact, one which
we may find proved every day both in our own
experience and the experience of other people,
that he who makes another unhappy generally
makes himself still more wretched.</p>

<p>If our experience shows us any exceptions to
this rule, it is, after all, only in seeming. He
who can make another unhappy and not be conscious
of it, is among those whom Epictetus
calls blind in that knowledge which distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>212</span>eth
right from wrong. He has not felt his close
relation, or, indeed, any relation to his fellows.
He cannot know any of the joys of fellowship,
and he will not find the pleasure he expects even
in his own pursuits. For it matters little, so
far as seeing is concerned, whether a man be
born blind, or whether he keeps his eyes tightly
bandaged all his days. In either case he gets
none of the sensations of pleasure that come
from being able and willing to see. If we persist
in having “our own way,” we must pay
the price. Most of the miseries of life are
caused by failure to get in harmony with the
laws of life. This is as simple and self-evident
as walking up the street. If we persist in keeping
to the left on a busy sidewalk, we shall be
jostled and pushed until we are sore and out
of breath and make but little headway withal.
But, if we are careful to walk with the crowd
going in our direction, if we remember always
to keep to the right, we shall find it easy to get
along even at the “rush” hour. Those who
do not observe this rule of harmonious progress
not only find walking on a busy street hard
work, but they also make it harder for others.
One man walking the wrong way may compel
twenty more to violate the sidewalk customs to
overcome his opposition. But, when everyone
observes the rule, it leads to a saving of time
and temper and makes life safer for all who are
in the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>213</span></p>

<p>Generally speaking, we recognize no law but
that of our own will, which is by no means the
same thing as the far-wider law of our being.
We cannot separate our lives from the greater
life. While we follow the law of our own will,
self-will, we never know real happiness or rest.
Like many another man-made law, our antagonistic
wills are a perversion of the natural law
which governs our lives.</p>

<small>THE NATURAL LAW</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">But</span>  what is the law of our being? It is harmony,
peace, rest. We have but to look at
the workings of our own marvelous physical
bodies to perceive that law. The more we study
the human body, the more we wonder at its
mechanism. Yet every part of this intricate
machinery, in harmony with each other part,
finds its own work, unless man, through his misunderstanding,
throws it out of order.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest proof of the naturally
harmonious working of the body is found in the
responsive distress or disease which result
from the wrong use of any one function. It is
not necessary to cut the heart itself to injure
it. To sever an artery anywhere will interfere
with the perfection of the heart’s work as effectively
as a direct injury to the heart. To
bring bad news may stop its action forever.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to strike the head to cause
a headache; that will follow if we abuse the
stomach, or live so that the liver becomes deranged.
We get these results because of the
perfect harmony in which all the parts of the
body work when we conform to the law of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>216</span>
being. The pain is a kindly monitor, warning
us that we have violated some law and bidding
us get into line once more. It is always wise
to heed such warning, gratefully.</p>

<p>Suppose that a man has a cellar which is so
dark and damp and dirty that he hates to go
into it, and tries to forget it. But it is flooded
in a storm, and he is forced to go down to examine
it, and then finds that the wall is unsafe,
and must be supported, else the house may fall.
Will he not say, “It was well that the flood
came that took me down into the depths, so that
I might find what was endangering my property
and the lives of my family?”
And if, in addition, he not only reinforces and
buttresses the wall, but also lets in the light and
cleans up the cellar, he will actually remove out
of his life what was always a disagreeable and
neglected task. He will add to the value of his
property, and have besides a security in his
house that he would never have had but for
the “accident.”
So we, if we heed the first pain that tells us
we have violated the law of harmony in our
physical body, may be led into a better and
truer understanding of ourselves than ever
before.</p>

<p>If the law of the physical body is harmony,
peace, rest, it must be true that the law of the
intelligence and the law of the spirit are the
same. If it were not so, there would be con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>217</span>stant
warring between the three natures—physical,
intellectual, and emotional—and happiness
and rest would be impossible.</p>

<p>Harmony, peace, rest are the blessings that
all men crave, even when they do not understand
their own desires. To say that peace and
rest are inherently impossible of attainment
is to say that we are formed with desires that
tantalize and torment us, as a mirage tantalizes
the traveler dying of thirst in the desert, with
no hope of satisfying those desires. It is in
effect to say that a cruel monster governs this
world and takes delight in our suffering.</p>

<p>He who tries with apparent disregard of harmony
to enforce his own will is, after all, striving
in his blind and hopeless way for harmony.
He thinks that to make his will supreme would
bring peace, and so he tries to have his own
way: that accounts for much tyranny, especially
domestic tyranny.</p>

<p>That so few do attain happiness and rest in
their lives is because of this misunderstanding
of life rather than from any inability to gain
happiness and rest. We allow trifles to distract
us from our real purpose. We feel ourselves
so pressed and oppressed by petty cares
that we cannot find time during the day to do
all that we feel we must do. It would be well
for us to follow Pitt’s rule, to do our part in
the world instead of trying to run it.</p>

<p>If that rule worked in his high and re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>218</span>sponsible
position, it would probably work in
our less important places. Most of us spend
our strength for that which is naught, largely
because we do not examine the nature of the
“duty” which presents itself to us. We should
probably find that our duties are not worth doing,
or else that another could do them as well.</p>

<p>Rest brings sleep more than sleep brings
rest.</p>

<span class="smcap">Lord Neaves.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A frequent</span> cause of suffering among
men and women is their idea that they are
necessary to the running of things. Usually
they find themselves mistaken. The head of a
firm was once warned by a physician that he
must take a rest to avert a breakdown, but the
man declared it to be an impossibility for him
to get away from the office for even a week. He
gripped his business so tight that he could not
let go, nor could he see that others could do
it as well as he could. In such a state of mind
the doctor’s warning added another worry, fear
for himself,—so at last the predicted breakdown
came. He had reached the point where he had
to let go, for his grip, both physical and mental,
was gone. For six months he could not
concern himself with business affairs, the necessity
of fighting for life and renewed health
occupying all his faculties. He refused to let
himself think of the outcome, but put his attention
upon getting well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>220</span></p>

<p>When he returned to his business, with his
mind braced to stand any disasters that he
might discover, he was astonished to find everything
in perfect condition, and that his assistant
had even corrected the errors he had himself
made in the last weeks of overworked body
and fagged brain. It was at first a blow to
his pride that he was not essential to the success
of his own business, but, as he realized
how big a price he had paid to learn this simple
lesson, he made a decision that showed how
far he had advanced beyond his former
condition.</p>

<p>Turning to his assistant, he said: “Smith, as
you can carry on this business so well, I shall
take three months’ vacation every year, and
have no more expensive breakdowns; and, as
I want you to continue to carry it on as well
while I am away, you would better take three
months’ vacation every year, too, so there shall
be no breakdowns for you.” He had really
learned two lessons in one—what things were
not worth doing, and what things could be done
by somebody else. He still had left “the
things that were quite enough for any man to
attempt.”
No man is really indispensable to any undertaking,
however much it may seem so to
him. When James Alexander controlled the
Equitable Life Assurance Society, he made it
his rule to discharge anybody who seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>221</span>
be indispensable. His reason for this was that,
the longer such a man was retained, the more
indispensable he would become, until the association
would be in danger of going to smash if
anything happened to that one man. Common
prudence dictated the advisability of getting
rid of him while the company could manage to
get along somehow without him.</p>

<p>There was once a Dutchman who was of much
the same opinion as Mr. Alexander. His manager
applied for an increase of salary.</p>

<p>“I t’ink I buys you bretty dear, alretty,
Hans.” “Yes,” said Hans, “I get a good salary,
but then I am worth it. I know everything
and do everything about the business; in fact,
you couldn’t get along without me.”
“Ach, ish dot so? Vell; vat I do if you vas
deat, Hans?”
“Oh, well! if I were dead, you’d have to get
along without me.”
“Ach!” replied the Dutchman, slowly,
“den, Hans, I t’inks we gonsiders you deat.”
It is well to think sometimes of how nicely
the world got along before we came to it, and
how likely it is to do just as well after we have
left it. If, when we are rushing around,
weighed down by anxiety and a feeling of our
own importance, we should “consider ourselves
dead” for a few moments, we might find that
the fever of life had subsided.</p>

<p>We should have to admit that, judging from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>222</span>
the past, the world would not even slip a cog
if we were to pass from it. And even if we
were ready to claim that no one heretofore had
been so important, and no one could ever again
be so necessary, even then it were the part
of wisdom to cease hurrying and worrying.
For, as the human frame can be exhausted by
overwork and overworry, it behooves the indispensable
person to preserve himself as long as
possible, so as to save the world from the catastrophe
of his loss. The very thing he aims to
do—save the world—he defeats by his anxiety
and haste.</p>

<p>Proper prudence tends to prevent trouble,
not to prevent worry. No amount of precaution
and care will cure worry. In fact, the
prudence and care help to fix the thought on
all the mischances, however improbable or impossible,
that may be imagined.</p>

<p>Elaborate precautions often defeat themselves,
like a corporal who kept all his squad
out as pickets till they were cut off one by one.</p>

<p>I once saw a family going off to the country,
five “masters” and three servants, eight hand-packages,
coachman, footman, and an extra
servant, and the family doctor to get them off.
The cautious doctor got the tickets days before,
and even got checks for the trunks. An extra
trunk, taken at the last hour to hold some extra
things that might be needed, upset all that
arranging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>223</span></p>

<p>The doctor went to the baggage-room in the
gray dawn to get that precautionary trunk
checked: after a long discussion about the place,
he arranged to meet the family at the railway
news-stand. The caretaker was shown once
more how to work the burglar alarm, from
which a necessary knob came off in the nervous
hand of the Master of Cares—“telephone for
the electrician”  but at last the blinds were
carefully pulled down, the house shut up
and committed to Providence and the caretaker,
and the family and its familiars arrived
at the station nearly an hour before train-time,
“getting off so nicely.”
The Genius of Forethought sent out a pair
of scouts to find the doctor. They returned, to
report that there were three news-stands, but
the doctor was not at any of them.</p>

<p>Then this Genius of Care went himself with
one of the scouts, a long and hurried walk to
the baggage-room,—not there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the doctor, who had stayed to
see the trunks off, had found the main body
with its camp-followers and light baggage. All
stood in the station near a news-stand and
waited for the return of the expedition, till
the doctor got impatient as train-time approached
and went off to find the Head of the
House, who arrived in a flurry, having lost his
own head a few minutes after he had gone
with the tickets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>224</span></p>

<p>At last, after the pilgrimage from the ticket-gate
down to the parlor-car, they are in the
train, all safe, thank God; but the Genius of
Care did not sleep that night “on account of
the worry and fuss of getting off.” That was
not the doctor’s fault. Like Martha, he had
made his own punishment the same as the rest
of us by being “<i class="em">careful</i> about many things.”
I remember an Irish servant who was shown
one of our big banks with its huge window-bars,
to make it safe. “Sure,” she said, “what’s
the good of them things? The thieves is inside
and not out.”
Worry is inside and not out, and Sleep, like
the Kingdom of Heaven, is not taken by force.</p>

<small>REST IN TRUTH</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">
The timely dew of sleep.<br />

<span class="smcap">Milton.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>  is not our work that wears us, but the way
we take it. So long as we think of rest as
meaning only inactivity, just so long will the
activities of life exhaust us. Goethe said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rest is not quitting the busy career,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rest is fitting oneself for one’s sphere.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When we do that, we find rest. But we may ask
what is one’s sphere and how may one fit one’s
self for it? If we wish to answer that truly,
we must be willing to have some common misconceptions
brushed away. The sphere of any
individual is limited only by the possibilities of
his own body, mind, and spirit. Our sphere is
not a small circle of activities whose boundaries
any man may mark. It widens as our
inner nature expands, and what was the horizon
line yesterday will be but a tiny hillock near
at hand to-morrow. It includes all that has
been achieved, and all that may be attained by
the race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>226</span></p>

<p>The best standard of our life is not only what
the race as a whole has achieved in the way of
development, but the highest and best that any
person has yet taught or lived; this is the true
measure of man’s sphere to-day. Ordinarily,
we talk of man’s sphere and woman’s sphere
as if there were a clear line of separation between
them, and each were continued in its own
little space. This could not be, for, so long as
men and women have the same three natures—bodily,
mental, spiritual—so long as we have
similar needs, aims, and aspirations, the larger
sphere of man, whether male or female, is the
same, and is bounded only by the possibilities
of the life of all three natures.</p>

<p>To fit one’s self for such a sphere should
bring rest while we are doing it, because
that fitting means becoming harmonious with
the purposes of the larger life; and rest is
simply harmony, at-one-ness with the Universe.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the life of all three
natures are inexhaustible. We have never
touched the limit of even the physical man.
Man at one time had only his hands for tools,
and so was limited in his powers. But he used
his mind to increase the power of his hands, and
reached out for sticks and stones to help him.
In time his thought devised implements that
increased his physical power a thousandfold,
until now he has harnessed not only steam, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>227</span>
the very currents of the air, and is making himself
all-powerful.</p>

<p>He does not wholly understand the forces he
tries to control, but he studies them, experiments
upon them, and makes servants of them
as far as he has grasped their laws. Had he
insisted upon considering his mind and his
physical powers as entirely separate and refused
to use them together, he might still have
claws for hands, and might still be a mere
burrower in the earth. Moreover, his mind
would not have developed as it has. Steam
and electricity might have aroused his curiosity,
but he would not have known how to make
them to do his will.</p>

<p>Further, if man had been able to keep his
intellect apart from his spirit, he would not
have developed the qualities that lift him
above the more intelligent animals. Sympathy
and justice and love would not have come into
his relations with his fellow-men.</p>

<p>These moral feelings expressed in our
bodies, our minds, and our hearts are some of
the possibilities of the life of all three natures,
and to endeavor to know and harmonize them,
thus “fitting one’s self for one’s sphere,” would bring us the happiness that follows action
and the rest that flows from selfless purpose
or harmony.</p>

<p>If we consider what the true object of life
is, we cannot help trying to see the connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>228</span>
between the three natures of man. It does not
seem possible that the life of any thinking being
was intended to be a purposeless jarring jumble,
or, as poor Stephen Blackpool said, “a’ a
muddle.” We find such harmony in the life
of the material world that we may expect to
find a similar harmony in the life of man. So
soon as we discover this, we see also that there
must be harmony between the life of the material
world and the life of man, and further
harmony between both the material and the
human life, and the Source of all life. Seeing
this, and living it, is fitting ourselves for our
sphere, preparing ourselves to take our destined
places in the Universe as Men and
Women.</p>

<small>THE SPAN OF LIFE</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is rounded with a sleep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Only</span>  a generation ago it was the custom
for men and women to begin to grow old
at about forty-five. A person of fifty was always
called “old,” and a man was expected to
be decrepit at sixty, a woman much earlier. It
is not wonderful that such men begrudged the
time spent in sleep.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, we used shamelessly to
print books in big type, indorsed “For the
Aged,” on the theory that everyone must be
nearly blind at maturity. Even now Dr. George
F. Stevens thinks that everyone “ought” to
wear glasses after forty, notwithstanding that
many Christian Scientists and Mental Scientists
discard them long after that age.</p>

<p>There is as much truth as wit in the saying
that “A man is as old as he feels, a woman
as old as she says she is.” We used to insist
upon every year being counted and noted, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>230</span>
in dress, occupation, and general demeanor.
But we have changed all this—even natty dress
now common to older people shows it—but the
change has come about slowly, and there are
still many who think that people of sixty should
give up all active life and prepare to “grow old
gracefully,” that is, to drop willingly into
senility. Those who are willing so to slip into
uselessness quietly, need much sleep; but even
for them the sleep is not a waste of time, but
an aid to length of days.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal too much willingness
to let go of active life, because of the idea
that “threescore years and ten” was the natural
limit of man’s life, and that to live beyond
seventy-five was to live upon “borrowed
time.” There is a sort of tickle for the mental
palate in that expression “borrowed time,” but
there is no substance in it, if we will but examine
it. How can there be “borrowed” time
and from whom is it borrowed?</p>

<p>Life is not a thing that begins to-day and
ends to-morrow. So far as we know, it has
neither beginning nor end. It is beyond our
power to picture a limit to all life. Well, if
life has neither beginning nor end, if it has no
limits, and if time is merely the unit by which
we measure seasons, why should there be a
limit to what we can use of it, and how could
a continued use of it be called “borrowing”?</p>

<p>In the earlier days of the race, when all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>231</span>
progress was made through might, and war
settled every question, when a man’s “work” meant chasing over the hills, when men fared
hard, and knew little of Nature; when fear was
the supreme emotion—it is probable that seventy
years represented a long life. To escape
all the chances of death from accident and ignorance
for so long a time was an achievement,
and, in this way, doubtless, seventy years came
to be regarded as the natural period of man’s
physical existence.</p>

<p>But with our increasing knowledge, with the
extension of means for making life easier, with
our conquest of Nature, there is no excuse for
limiting ourselves or our fellows to the same
short span. Consequently man’s life began to
extend over a longer and longer period as the
risks of living were diminished by civilization.
War became a less common condition; the very
inventions for making war more destructive of
life helped to make people consider whether
disputes could not be more wisely settled. The
next step was a natural outcome of that reasoning.
The latest wars have had more casualties
and less fatalities; partly because the effort
has been to incapacitate the fighting-men rather
than to kill them off. We have begun to see
dimly, at least, that the taking of life does not
settle any question. This leads to a greater respect
for life, and from respect to preservation
is an easy step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>232</span></p>

<p>The intelligent man to-day does not make his
whole life a mere struggle to exist for his “allotted
span.” Rather, he aims to preserve and
prolong his life by exertion and, even more,
by repose. He has learned that, while it is
true that “not enjoyment and not sorrow is
our destined end or way,” yet to enjoy, in the
sense of understanding life and living, is to
live so that “each to-morrow find us farther
than to-day.”
To enjoy life is to use it wisely; to get the
most out of it that will make for happiness
and development. It will not help to that end
to worry or lose sleep, because man’s span of
life is short. Love with your whole heart, and
live according to reason, and you will win the
prize of sleep, and happiness and length of
days shall be added thereunto.</p>

<small>WASTE STEAM</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span>  there is one thing more than another for
which Americans are noted, it is “nervous
energy.” To this we attribute our notable
achievements in science, industry, and literature.
To this energy, also, or rather to the
misuse of it, may be attributed the dyspepsia,
the nervous headaches, the general “breakdowns,” and the suicides so much more prevalent
of late years.</p>

<p>An abundant supply of nervous energy is one
of the blessings of life, it denotes almost unlimited
capacity for work and enjoyment. It
is the steam that drives the engine; and which,
under the control of a skilled engineer, pulls
the train upgrade as well as on the level. It is
only through ignorance or carelessness that the
engine is allowed to run wild, and destroys
that which it was meant to convey safely.</p>

<p>So with the people who “go to pieces nervously.” There has been an unskilled hand on
the lever. Through ignorance or carelessness,
the nervous energy has been badly handled, and
the force that should convey us safely through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>234</span>
life has caused our destruction. We should be
as careful with our minds as with our
machines.</p>

<p>When we find ourselves getting nervous and
worried, sleepless, “blue,” or dyspeptic; or
showing any of the numerous signs of misdirected
energy, such as short temper or headaches,
we should take a day off to examine the
engine. It is time well spent, as we may thereby
learn something that will avert a complete
breakdown.</p>

<p>If we find that we are not overeating, overworking,
or overworrying; not feeling animosity,
nor suffering from an excessive idea of personal
importance—if, in fact, there are no
fears gnawing our heartstrings nor any other
large and well-defined cause of trouble, we may
well look closer for small causes. “The foxes—the
little foxes that spoil the vines.”</p>

<p>There are often disturbing causes that we
fail to notice as disturbing. For instance, disorder
about us, the habit of stirring everything
up and throwing everything around when we
set to work. The confusion communicates itself
to our feelings, besides which the uncertainty
as to where we have put what we want next
upsets our nerves.</p>

<p>It is a good plan, when we find ourselves
“rattled” or not working easily, to stop and
clear things up, put everything in order. It
is marvelous how often that will smooth out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>235</span>
the creases both in face and temper and make
the world look pleasant again.</p>

<p>If that itself proves to be a certain strain or
an annoyance, leave the whole thing and go out
for a while, or take a nap, or even smoke, if you
do not feel that smoking hurts you. Anything
that will distract the attention from the seemingly
annoying circumstances will relieve the
pressure on overwrought nerves and allow the
system to regain its poise.</p>

<p>At this point it will sometimes serve to put
into practice the rule that William Pitt, Prime
Minister of Great Britain, laid down for himself:
When overwhelmed with official duties, he
divided his work into three parts—that which
was not worth doing, that which would do itself,
and that which was quite enough for any
man to attempt. Make a list of all the things
you have to do, then go over that list and make
it into three. Pick out first the things that
could be left undone, because not really worth
the effort they require. Having settled them,
you will find your load already lightened.</p>

<p>Next select those things that you want to do,
but which somebody else could do just as well.
Make that list carefully. It is the hardest one
of the three. It is comparatively easy to decide
that a thing we may wish to do is not
worth the effort it will cost, but it is quite another
matter to admit that somebody else could
do those things just as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>236</span></p>

<p>And there is a reason for this feeling apart
from mere ordinary conceit, although it may
only be a more subtle form of conceit—self-approbativeness,
as the phrenologists call it. It
has its rise in our belief that, while our way of
doing that particular thing may be no better
than another’s way, yet it is “different,” and
we long to see the result of that different way.
Nevertheless, it may be that the best good of
all concerned requires that somebody else do
that thing, and our nervous restlessness is
merely a warning for us to omit doing it ourselves.</p>

<p>Then, in the things left on the original list,
we shall find all that one person should undertake,
and we shall do them with a zest and ease
that could not have been ours working in any
other way. For myself, when all else fails, and
none of these devices does away with the feeling
of being pushed by my work, I close my
desk and go for a walk. If soothed, I return in
an hour or two and take up my work easily;
otherwise, I leave it all until another day; it
saves time in the end. Circumstances prevent
many persons from doing that: but we can do
it, in greater or less degree, far oftener than we
think.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to stop long enough
to find out what is the matter. If a good engineer
finds his engine running hard, he examines
it to finds the trouble. If your watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>237</span>
goes irregularly, you take it to an expert to
find the cause of irregularity. Why should we
be less careful with our minds?</p>

<p>What is needed is simply obedience to the
laws of Nature that we know, but the case may
be one for the physical culturist, for the mental
therapeutist, for the moral teacher, or even for
the alienist. Where common sense fails or is
wanting, we should consult an expert before it
is too late. (See Appendix A.)</p>

<small>UNDERSTANDING</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast no figures and no fantasies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which busy care draws in the brains of men;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">All</span>  unrest and uneasiness, all impatience
and disharmony are due to some misunderstanding
of life and its unity, of its unchanging
and unchangeable laws. Froebel’s
recognition of this principle created his idea of
education as growth by exercise, the greatest
definition of training that has yet been given to
the world. He says that education consists in
relating the individual life to the external life,
the inner to the outer, or, in other words, it
consists in getting the individual into harmony
with the whole of life.</p>

<p>This is the substance of the doctrine of all
the great thinkers of the world, the essential
oneness in the teachings of all the philosophers
of every race and of all the ages. Each gives
expression to the special side of this oneness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>239</span>
that presented itself most strongly to him, but
on the plan of life they agree.</p>

<p>Although many of the followers of these
great teachers have been able to see the beauty
of their conceptions, few have been able to
transmit them as pure and bright as they received
them. It is by no means easy to avoid
interpreting what we hear in a merely personal
way. Seldom do the “hearers of the
Word” have the humility “of the broken and
empty vessel,” so well expressed in a hymn at
one time popular among revivalists:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Empty, that He might fill me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As forth to His service I go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broken, that so unhindered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His life through me might flow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">Instead of that, we have tried to make the truth
fit our ideas of “personal” life, when we
should have made our “personal” life fit the
truth.</p>

<p>One cannot conceive of the Universe growing
weary, of infinity becoming exhausted, because
material science has shown us that harmonious
laws govern all life. Scientists have
been able to state laws that experience has
shown to be unfailingly true. For example, take
the heavenly bodies: through the study and comparison
of their motions, astronomers have
stated laws that apply to all that is known of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>240</span>
them, and which illustrate the perfection of the
solar system. To-day, if some asteroid is discovered
which seems to move in opposition to
known laws, no one supposes that the laws are
wrong. So impossible is any haphazard occurrence
in the solar system that astronomers
know that any disturbance simply shows some
existence or activity not hitherto observed.
They do not doubt the unchangeable universal
nature of the laws; but they recognize that only
lack of knowledge prevents our understanding
the relation of what we see to the laws that
govern it, and they bend every effort to the
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>If we but look upon the occurrences of human
life with the same confidence, there is no
cause for worry and uneasiness. Why should
man chafe? Because of those who do ill?
“Fret not thyself because of evildoers,” for
they, too, have their uses. Every man is in the
plan of God. It may be that he is here simply
to show us something that we should not otherwise
have seen. Had not someone done the ill
and made the results known, many men might
have made like mistakes and the consequences
have been much worse than they are. Says
Ernest Crosby:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I thank the kind round-shouldered men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And treat them with respect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For teaching me to raise my chin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hold myself erect.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>241</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No man can tell how much more he owes to
the things that he would have made different
had he shaped his own life, than to the things
he regards as good.</p>

<p>Most advances that we accomplish are forced
upon us by circumstances with which we are discontented,
and our happiness consists in recognizing
that there is, in effect, no such thing as
misfortune. There is no chance in the world:
everything is the result of Energy; nothing
ever happens by accident. I said once to a
woman standing beside the coffin of her husband,
trying to comfort her and trying to teach
myself, “You know, this did not happen by
chance.” “No,” she said, “I know that; if
one chance got loose, it would wreck the world.” So it would.</p>

<p>You toss up a coin and it seems to you to be
chance whether it comes down heads or tails.
It isn’t chance at all. If one thing happened
by chance, you would know that it was the end
of natural law. Suppose that the thing to be
tossed were an iron plate, ten feet across by
two feet thick, then the engineer could figure
out just how many pounds of powder would turn
it once and how many would turn it twice or
three times; and, if you told him when he had
adjusted his charge that it was chance which
side would come up, he would say that you did
not understand dynamics. He knows that there
is no chance about it; that the number of turns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>242</span>
depends exactly upon the amount of force, and
how it is applied. So it is with the tossing of
the penny; it may seem to be chance to us because
we cannot measure or perceive the
causes, but its fall is as directly and fixedly
due to causes as the sinking of an ocean-liner.</p>

<p>It is not likely that Charles Dickens would
have chosen the hard childhood he had if he
could have arranged his own life, but there is
little room to doubt that much of his understanding
and sympathy, much of the power
that made him the novelist of the masses, was
due to those experiences. Even though he may
never have seen during his life how necessary
those experiences were, nor accepted them philosophically,
that did not alter their use. The
work of the “evildoers” in giving Socrates
hemlock to drink did not destroy Socrates’ usefulness;
the death by the cross did not check
the spread of the good news the Nazarene
brought to man.</p>

<p>Men have always stoned the prophets and
killed those who would bring deliverance. This
is an expression of the conservatism which is
the balance-wheel of the race: if it were not for
that, the leaders of the people would get so far
in advance as to be clear out of sight. But
the prophecies have been fulfilled, and, step by
step, deliverance has been won. Moreover,
whom one generation destroyed, succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>243</span>
generations have honored; it is impossible to
get the rear rank in line with the vanguard.
But wherein has evil triumphed or the law of
good been set aside?</p>

<p>In the study of history we see the persistent
progress of the race. However slow the march,
it has always been from darkness into light,
from low aims and small ideas to higher purposes
and larger thoughts. Each nation has
contributed something to the sum of that progress.
Not only have they had glimpses at their
best of better things, but even at their worst
they have caused other nations to see and avoid
like errors or cruelties. In this way the
civilized and the savage have both helped to
advance civilization. And, if the blind works
of evildoers do not triumph over the plans of
Good, if they do not even hinder the working
of the law of universal Good, why should we
fret ourselves because of them?</p>

<p>But the unrest may be caused by our lack of
that worldly success which we think would
bring us happiness. Of course, if the real desire
be worldly success, and there is no other
way in which we can learn that it will not bring
happiness, then we must attain worldly success.
To-day, this demands a resolute will,
concentration, a steady nerve, and a lack of
human sympathy. It is difficult for us to see
this in our own case when we make worldly
success our aim, but, if we examine the career<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>244</span>
of any “successful” man, we shall see how
true it is.</p>

<p>Nothing is truer of modern business life than
that the success of one involves the failure or
seeming failure of many. We have but to look
around at the few who are acclaimed by the
world as successful business men and the many
who toil for a bare subsistence, to find the proof
of this. To succeed, a man must first resolve
to succeed, and must concentrate all his powers
to that end. He must have iron nerves so that
unexpected good-or ill-fortune may not upset
him, and he must so steel his heart that he may
not see the needs or hear the groans of his
suffering fellows, if to hear or heed would interfere
with his purpose.</p>

<p>After men have attained worldly success,
they sometimes give liberally to charity and
public purposes. Nobody has yet revealed how
much of that giving is atonement for the half-remembered
times when some heart was hardened,
some ear deafened, and some hand tight
closed against the cry of the needy. Some rich
men unhappily become so hard of heart, so
bound by the habit of refusing, that giving becomes
an impossibility.</p>

<p>Now worry and unrest upset the nerve, disturb
the concentration, and keep alive at least
one phase of human sympathy—that which we
call irritation. We do not usually regard irritation
as an expression of sympathy, but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>245</span>
is just what it is. Irritation towards our fellows
is an indication that we cannot rid ourselves
of the knowledge that they have claims
upon us. It is an evidence that we do not understand
them, or that we are not in harmony
with them. That may be because their aims are
so different from ours that they are a standing
rebuke to our selfishness, or because their aims
are so similar to ours that they become a threat
to us. In either event they are forced upon our
attention, and we are unable to forget them.
We are not able to crush them ruthlessly if
they stand in our way, for to do so causes us
pain and dissatisfaction, and prevents our joy
in our success. Sometimes, when the pain and
dissatisfaction become keen enough, they may
even turn us from our purpose, and thus destroy
our chance of worldly success.</p>

<p>Thus worry and unrest defeat the very thing
we are aiming at, and leave us out of harmony
with the laws governing the accomplishment of
our purpose. Even in business and in matters
of health, that rest which comes from a cool,
steady purpose, undisturbed by fretfulness or
impatience, is the main factor of success.</p>

<small>THE SUPERSTITION OF FEAR</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">
Fear of Death thus dies in senseless sleep.<br />

<span class="smcap">Beaumont.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Primitive</span>  man feared thunder, and,
being unable to explain it, made a god of
it, offered sacrifices to it in the hope of averting
the harm it might do. Fear has perverted
many religions. What man feared he first
crouched before in helpless terror, and afterwards
knelt before in wonder and worship. In
the early days of the race he looked upon every
new or strange thing with terror, because he
did not understand its connection with the
things he knew.</p>

<p>Man first knew himself as a physical creature
with certain needs and cravings that must be
gratified if he were to live at all. He did not
at first realize that the presence of another person
would make life easier and more secure for
him; rather, he feared that every other would
injure him. Later, as men formed themselves
into groups, clans and tribes, each recognized
the interests of the immediate group as of supreme
importance, but feared the other groups.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>247</span>
This was the origin of “Honor thy father and
thy mother, that thy days may be long in the
land.” Those families that obeyed their natural
leader, the patriarch, held together and survived;
the others were separated and destroyed.
The early records of the Jews are
scarcely more than a chronicle of the wars of
a coherent race against various other tribes inhabiting
that part of Asia, together with the
lessons to be drawn from its experience. Even
in the vast new continent of America, different
tribes of Indians roving its plains looked upon
other tribes with distrust and hatred, and made
war upon them. There was plenty of land; animal
life abounded; there was nothing in the
aims and pursuits of one tribe that was necessarily
injurious to any other, yet apprehension
and the superstition of enmity kept them apart.</p>

<p>The world has not yet got rid of this old superstition.
In this modern Christian era there
is scarcely a civilized nation which does not
keep itself in readiness to attack its neighbor.
All the peace the nations yet know is an armed
peace, so that even when we cry, “Peace,
peace!” we know “there is no peace,” because
man does not yet trust his fellowman. He is
fearful of him, not only as encroaching upon
his actual territory, but he resents his competition
even in the making of the tools and goods
that civilized life demands.</p>

<p>We erect tariff walls, that the people of other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>248</span>
countries may not easily sell to us the goods
they make, forgetting that, even without those
walls, they could not sell their goods to us, if we
did not want them. For, in free buying and
selling, the desire must be mutual, else there
will be no exchange.</p>

<p>In all the relations of the most modern
civilized society the effect of this distrust, of
one toward another, is plain to be seen. Even
those who devote their lives to preaching the
doctrine of the gentle Nazarene do not always
grasp the full significance of that doctrine. The
city of Toledo, Ohio, is blessed with a mayor
who has lost all distrust in man (or perhaps
he never learned it) and, in his efforts to administer
civic affairs on a basis of love and
understanding, he is finding his strongest opponents
in some of the preachers of the community.
Such is the blinding effect of misunderstanding
the unity of all life.</p>

<p>It cannot, therefore, be a matter of surprise
to the student of present-day affairs that his
ancestors were slow to learn about other groups
what their still earlier ancestors had learned of
individuals. As the circle of man’s interests
enlarged, including more and more fellow-creatures,
he began to come more and more
into harmonious relations with the Universe.
Out of his personal experience he began to perceive
the mutual interests and the underlying
oneness of human life, and, through that per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>249</span>ception,
some have now begun to realize the
oneness of all life.</p>

<p>This is the road along which man must travel
to reach harmony, and harmony is rest. It is
living in accord with the universal law which
regulates the growth and development of all
things as well as their activities. To the undeveloped
savage the whole material universe,
so far as he could see it, was a jumble of inharmonious
and unrelated things—he saw no
relation between the different bodies in the
heavens as they circled in their orbits; each
created thing seemed to have its separate existence,
which had to be maintained without
regard to any other form of life. But science
has shown us that the heavenly bodies, however
huge or remote, are all parts of one great system,
under one perfect law. We know now that,
instead of the earth being the center of the
universe, round which all the stars, suns,
moons, and other bodies revolve, it is itself but
a tiny unit in a tremendous system of systems.</p>

<p>All of these bodies have been circling in their
orbits for untold millions of years, unaffected
by the fact that no man knew of them. It is
not too much to expect that they will continue
to perform their circlings according to those
same laws even after science has taught us all
it is possible to discover. Man may profit from
his knowledge of universal laws, but he cannot
alter them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>250</span></p>

<p>And yet the man of average intelligence even
to-day feels that things universal in relation to
humanity and its needs are at “sixes and
sevens,” and that his anxiety and feverish activity
are needed to alter or better them. He
still sees men as separate beings with interests
that clash.</p>

<p>It is this failure to understand that every
life is bound up for good with all other lives
which leads us to worry about our “personal” affairs, and thus to miss the rest that clear understanding
would bring.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span>  we learn to confine our attention to
“the things that are quite enough for
any man to attempt,” we shall find that there
is little real ground for worry or fretting in our
daily life. It is a fact that, if our work wearies
or exhausts us, either we are doing the wrong
thing or else doing it in the wrong way. For
the Spirit of Life is no taskmaster. It is we
who make this world a daily grind. It is not
naturally a “vale of tears” nor a “wilderness
of woe.” </p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Joy upon joy and gain upon gain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are the destined rights of my birth,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and we may all have those rights if we claim
them as our own. Worry is a disease that some
people enjoy as much as some others enjoy invalidism.
There are some people who can
hardly speak and think of anything but their
physical ailments; they never recall the morn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>252</span>ings
when they felt strong and vigorous, the
nights they slept soundly, but only the days
when they had uncomfortable sensations of
weakness or distress, and the nights when sleep
was somewhat broken. And you will notice
that they will say they “did not sleep well” when they mean that they did not sleep much.
We may always sleep <i class="em">well</i>, even though we do
not sleep much.</p>

<p>There are other people who, though they do
not weary us with accounts of their bodily
symptoms, tell us always of their cares. They
revel in tales of distress which shall go to show
how much more oppressed they are than their
fellows. They take their worries as the healthy
farmer takes his food, eagerly, and would be
distinctly upset if anything happened to interfere
with their enjoyment of them. If they are
going somewhere, they worry lest it should
rain, or lest something unforeseen should happen
to prevent the expedition. It is the same
old story, they want their “own way.” They
cannot conceive of a disappointment being a
blessing in disguise; they know of nothing so
hard to be borne as the setting aside of a passing
desire.</p>

<p>For such as these life is full of “bitter disappointments”;
cares and worries naturally
fall to their lot; the sun seldom shines for them,
and even when it does they think they can note
the spots upon it,—while the rain falls so heav<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>253</span>ily
and so frequently that it makes runnels over
their whole plan of life, reducing it to a scene
of desolation. And all the time the sun is shining,
and joys are awaiting them did they but
look in the right direction. They are “pulling
the wrong string,” as it were. A little child
kept calling to his mother that he could not find
what he was seeking, because he could not
“make the light come on.” His mother wisely
replied: “You are probably pulling the wrong
string, Harold. Pull the other.” The moment
he did so the electric light flooded the room,
and the child found what he sought. It had lain
right to his hand all the time, but he did not
know to pull the right string. Our heart’s desire
lies just as close to us.</p>

<p>Many a person who is always having trouble,
who is worried and uneasy, longing for rest and
comfort but never finding it; to whom “life
is a dreary puzzle scarcely worth the solving,” is simply “pulling the wrong string,” the
string of self-will, of separateness. His soul
is darkened by his refusal to turn on the light,
and the shadow covers the whole of his life.</p>

<p>The darkness is filled with imaginary terrors.
We people the corners with hobgoblins that do
not exist, and that in our hearts we know
could not exist. Little Bessie had for several
nights cried out in terror after she had been
put to bed, so that her mother was compelled
to go to her. At first she would not say what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>254</span>
had frightened her, but at last the story came
out.</p>

<p>“I was thinking how frightened I should be
if there was a bogey-man in the closet and he
should suddenly put his head out and make
faces at me.”
“But, child,” said her mother, “you know
there is no such thing as a bogey-man, so he
could not be in the closet, nor make faces at
you.”
“Yes, mother, I know that,” answered the
child, slowly; “but, mother, <i class="em">if</i> there was a
bogey-man, and he did get into my closet, and
if he did put out his head and make faces at
me, wouldn’t I be awfully frightened? Well,
it’s <i class="em">that</i> that makes me scream.”
And often the thing that makes us “scream” has no more existence in fact than Bessie’s
bogey-man. We get to turning things over in
our minds, dwelling upon dire possibilities until
they become actual to us, and we get as much
pain and suffering from them as we should if
they were real.</p>

<p>It would puzzle ourselves, if we gave the matter
attention, to discover why we are more
given to worrying than to rejoicing, if it is not
that we misunderstand life and its purposes.</p>

<p>Consider life just on its physical side, and we
shall see, as the Creator saw when he looked
upon it, that it is all very good. There are
more sunny days in the year than stormy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>255</span>
ones; there is more growing time than decaying
time, for spring, summer, and autumn comprise
three parts of the year, and growth continues
through them all; the moon shines always
somewhere, and “the stars come nightly to the
sky.” The bright-colored blossoms show more
than the somber-hued; more birds sing
sweetly than croak harshly, and even the croak
melts into the symphony as a needed note. The
purely material world points to joy and gladness
rather than to sorrow and repining.</p>

<p>Then, when we come to man, we find that he
has more strength than weakness, more health
than sickness, more power than inability, else
man had not survived the ages. Moreover, man
must have more capacity for enjoyment than
for sorrow, else he would abandon life in weariness,
or at best he would forget how to laugh;
the mere animal does not laugh, that is one of
man’s accomplishments.</p>

<p>Man has also more desire for knowledge than
for ease, else he would never have penetrated
into the secrets and mysteries of Nature;
man’s strong aspirations surmount his groveling
tendencies, else he had never come up out
of savagery into the light and development of
kinship with the high gods.</p>

<p>Then, why should we give way to repining?
All things point to the apostolic truth that
“Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
cometh in the morning.” And always the morn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>256</span>ing
comes. Moreover, the darkest night is seldom
starless if we look up intently enough. If
we blind our eyes with tears, we cannot see the
light even when the horizon is rosy with the
rising sun. Better by far is it to feel with

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span>  we aim at worldly success, thinking that
thereby we shall be able to do more for
mankind and be more useful, we may defeat
our own purpose by worry and anxiety. The
present moment is all that any man has in
which to come into agreement with his fellows.</p>

<p>If for lack of understanding he spends that
moment in worry and unrest, he makes himself
and everybody else more or less unhappy,
thereby destroys his own usefulness,
and proves his unfitness to gain success. But it
may be that he is deceived as to his motive; he
may desire success really for the satisfaction
of winning against his less fortunate fellows.</p>

<p>Why should we desire worldly success to enable
us to help our fellows? No amount of benevolence
or philanthropy can atone for the
selfishness, inhumanity and the greed necessary
to acquire great wealth under modern conditions.
The widow’s mite or the cup of cold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>258</span>
water given from moment to moment is of
greater value than the millions bestowed upon
charity as a sop to one’s conscience, or as a
pacifier of public clamor.</p>

<p>There is a degree of satisfaction in giving
<i class="em">all</i> that can never come from giving a portion
of superabundance. We never hear of a very
rich man giving all that he hath, over and above
a comfortable, or even a luxurious, living. His
giving hardly requires the sacrifice of even a
whim. How can a man like Rockefeller, with
an admitted income of nearly a dollar every
second, be generous? How much would he have
to give in order to feel it?—and what mischief
would he not do in giving such a sum! The
“luxury of giving” can never be his, for that
is the result of giving at the expense of our
daily desires. The widow who cast in her mite
enjoyed the luxury of giving, and many still
give in that way. This gift of somebody’s mite
incited the giving of millions.</p>

<p>But it is not possible that the gift of millions
should bring the giver much happiness, if it
brings any. There is too much publicity and
display in such a gift; it is noised abroad from
press and platform, and creates a new distress
in the mind of the giver. The giver knows that
unscrupulous, undeserving persons or causes
will now lay siege to a share of his wealth, because
of the notoriety his great gift has brought
him. Some are so oppressed with appeals that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>259</span>
they have to appoint committees to give away
the money. There must be about as much satisfaction
in that as in having a committee to
kiss the women you love.</p>

<p>Besides this, great benefactions cause uneasiness,
lest they be misapplied or unwisely
distributed, or lest the glory may be eclipsed
by some other millionaire giving a larger sum
to a more popular cause. Thus donations become
a source of unrest and worriment, and
the donor’s last state is worse than his first.
The giver of the mite is generally unknown of
the crowd, sometimes unknown even of the one
to whom he gives, so that his joy comes from
the giving, and cannot be taken from him. To
him alone is it true that “the gift is to the
giver” and that “it is more blessed to give
than to receive.”
If there is no real joy to be had from giving
of great wealth, why should we desire to have
it, or fret ourselves that we do not win it?
Neither to acquire wealth nor to possess it can
bring happiness or peace. We have seen how
great is the price we must pay to get great
riches, and it is easy to see why their possession
cannot bring peace or happiness.</p>

<p>Man has a limited number of wants, and
there is an end even to whims. When all of
these have been satisfied, what is left? The ordinary
man must give time, skill, thought, and
labor to satisfy his needs, and from the effort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>260</span>
he gets a large measure of joy and satisfaction.
Even if he never gets what he is after, the effort
has given him pleasure, strengthened his
purpose, and developed his whole nature. But
the wealthy man is denied this natural satisfaction.
He does not even have to seek what he
wants; servants do that for him; he speaks and
the thing is done. For him there is no joyous
effort; no increase of pleasure in the very delay
of fulfillment; no sense of achievement when
he gets what he desires. For this reason he
soon wearies, and, having run the whole gamut
of pleasures, and exhausted his idle fancies, he
becomes a prey to ennui, has no object in life,
and finds no delight in the days. It could not be
otherwise. As an old servant in my family once
said, “If the rich were happy, we should know
there was no God.”
“How hardly shall a rich man enter into
the kingdom of heaven,” said Jesus; meaning
thereby that the possession of wealth destroys
our sympathy with our poorer brethren and
prevents a man from seeing his true relation
to those who have it not; makes it difficult for
him to recognize his oneness with all mankind,
and so cuts him off from that heaven of love
and peace on earth that can come only from
agreement of his own life with the life of others
outside his circle.</p>

<p>If we are worried or ill at ease for any other
cause, such as ill-health, disappointed affec<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>261</span>tions,
unsatisfied desires, or from any of the innumerable
causes to which we attribute our ill,
we have but to examine them to find that in
every instance the underlying error is the same.
It is that we think of our separate interests,
that we are for self; that “me” has a deeper
significance to our mind than “us”  that the
“I” blots out the “thou.” All worry, all unrest
comes from self-seeking, from the feeling
of separateness rather than of oneness; from
an inharmonious attitude towards life and its
underlying verities.</p>

<p>“Seek ye first the kingdom of God,” said
the Teacher, “and all these things”—material
things, food and clothes that he had been speaking
of—“shall be added unto you.” Now God
is love, and the kingdom of God is universal
love, the love that knows no separateness;
therefore let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid. Believe in God. The man who
seeks first the wide Universal Peace does not
worry nor fret. He has, by that very seeking,
put himself in tune with the Infinite, and he
finds that the sounds which have seemed to him
like harsh discords are, to his listening ear,
blended into harmony. He has heard the
“sweetest carol ever sung” and nothing can
drown its melody. With that song in his ears
he can “run and never be wearied, he can walk
and not faint.” He loses his feverish impatience,
for “he that believeth shall not make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>262</span>
haste”;  he sees himself in every man and
every man in himself; he has found rest for his
soul.</p>

<p>When this peace reigns within, the seeming
ills of life do not disturb us. We are not conscious
of ungratified desires, and in this lies
the truth of the promise—“all things shall be
added unto you.” For, if man is not conscious
of any ungratified want or desire, then, though
he be poor in this world’s goods and entirely
unknown, he is richer by far than the multi-millionaire
who is compelled to heap silver upon
gold, or the pushing politician whose thirst for
fame can never be slaked. He is in harmony
with the Universe, he has allied himself with
moral gravitation, and, going with its force, he
is upheld and supported, so that he has rest
now and is neither worried nor afraid.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Inquiry</span>  into the causes and the cure of
sleeplessness leads us inevitably to one conclusion:
there must be peace of mind, harmonious
action and interaction of mind and body in
order to command the most refreshing sleep. A
man may not know which of the many theories
of sleep is correct—indeed, he may not know
that there are any theories about it, but, if he
lives a normal physical life and is at peace with
the world, he is likely to sleep well.</p>

<p>Since health of body, mind, and soul is essen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>264</span>tial
to our best development, and since sleep,
restful sleep, is essential to such health,
it would seem that such sleep is one of the
things which rightly belong to every individual.
And, if to individuals, then to groups of
individuals, to nations, to the whole race. The
race is subject to the same influence as the individual,
and, since the chief cause of the unrest
of individuals is their inharmonious relations
towards one another, so the chief cause of the
unrest of the race is its inherent discord.</p>

<p>Underlying the antagonisms of men to men
is the question of economics—“the science of
... living well for the state, the family, and
the individual,” as the Standard Dictionary defines
it. While the question of how he shall sustain
his mere physical existence—obtain the
food, clothes, and shelter so essential to his
maintenance—occupies all a man’s thought and
energy, he does not readily turn toward the
consideration of his deeper life. He feels that
every man is his enemy, ready and willing to
take from him, either by superior sharpness,
fraud, or force the opportunity of supplying
his needs.</p>

<p>So long as conditions lead anyone to adopt
this attitude towards his fellows, he is not apt
to give much time or thought to discovering
his proper relations toward them. Forces
stronger than any number of individuals, acting
separately, may drive men into combinations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>265</span>—
such as labor organizations among the masses,
or large corporations among the privileged
classes—until we find a sort of spurious co-operation
taking the place of individual effort.</p>

<p>But this co-operation is based upon the necessity
of combining to oppose and crush, not
upon the desire to avoid friction and bring
about harmonious relations between men.
Wherever either labor or capital organizes
to protect itself from the oppression of the
other and to dictate terms to it, that other in
its turn organizes to protect itself and to crush
the opposing power. Neither party to the
struggle sees its dependence upon the other.
Capital forgets that labor called it into existence,
that without labor there had been no
capital, and that should labor cease capital
would soon disappear. Labor does not see that
capital is its own product, drawn from the land
and used to enable men to produce more wealth.
And neither sees that the object of producing
wealth is not wealth for its own sake, but that
man may, through its use, develop himself to
an ever higher state.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible that men should see
this under present economic conditions; how,
then, can it be possible for men to understand
their relations to one another or the advantages
of harmony?</p>

<p>And, if economic conditions destroy man’s relations
to man, how much more completely do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>266</span>
they destroy man’s relation to the higher life,
to Nature or God? Even in his bitterest struggles
with his fellows, man recognizes that he
and those who oppose him are alike victims of
circumstances and must fight. The resentment
which he feels is less toward individuals than
to the circumstances which make them antagonists
when they should be coworkers, and he
does not see that the circumstances are of man’s
own creating.</p>

<p>So long as he regards these conditions as natural,
ordained by some power outside himself,
he cannot be expected to feel drawn towards
closer relations with that power. While he has
to watch his chance in the battle of life, he can
hardly see that to get in harmony with the laws
of the Universe, to recognize his oneness with
all life, is to leave struggle and unrest behind.
If life is nothing but struggle, he wonders how
any attitude can destroy or obviate struggling.</p>

<p>Viewed from his standpoint, he is right. If,
as man progresses, the desire to live well
strengthens and deepens, and if this desire can
be gratified only by waging relentless war
against men and conditions, then no study of
the relations of man to man or of man to life
can lead to anything but greater cunning and
more destructive methods of opposition. As
the individual finds no way to fulfill his desires
without fighting his neighbor, so the nation
learns of no way to advance except through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>267</span>
crushing other nations. There can rarely be
true internal peace for the individual and no
true rest and healthy growth for the nation
while unjust economic conditions are maintained.</p>

<p>Wherever an individual feels the pressure of
economic conditions too keenly he loses what
little poise he may have had. He becomes restless
and sleepless and the whole tone of his
mind and body is lowered. Where the distress
from such pressure becomes general, there the
nation loses tone; quarrels are readily picked
with other nations, and war is resorted to as a
means of reducing population and of destroying
all forms of wealth, so that a new demand may
be created and the economic pressure for a time
be lessened. These conditions recur again and
again at longer or shorter intervals, and always
the same futile means of meeting them is
adopted. Man so little understands life that
he has not learned that harmony with the laws
of the Universe underlies his economic relations
as well as his physical relations. If he
knew this, he would know that the distress and
dissatisfaction common to all nations could
come only from the violation of natural laws,
and he would begin to search out those laws.
Men for a long time held false ideas of the
laws of the solar system, and exhausted ingenious
devices and systems to explain its phenomena.
Then they began to discover under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>268</span>lying
laws which explain phenomena more satisfactorily:
some of those laws were found, and
our knowledge of the solar system to-day is
based upon these sure fundamentals.</p>

<p>It is as possible to make sure of the laws
governing our economic conditions as of those
that govern the solar system. They must lie at
the root of all things economic and must
explain all phenomena that any condition of society,
whether the most primitive or the most
complex, can produce. Until these laws are discovered
and applied the earth will “turn, troubled
in sleep,” and men may not know peace.</p>

looked over a world filled with injustice, for the
coming of the kingdom—but we have not seen
it. What is it that hides “the Kingdom at
hand” from our eyes? Is it not iniquity?
What kind of iniquity? We once had chattel
slavery, which was denounced as “the sum of
all villainies.” We still have monopoly of the
gift of God, which is the fundamental iniquity.
For every one of his children a loving father
made ample provision in the earth, but we have
allowed a few to monopolize it all; some nine
out of every hundred own our earth, and we
find that, under such circumstances, the laws of
God are impracticable; therefore, we say “the
Kingdom is not a real Kingdom—it is only in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>270</span>
men’s minds, only in some far-off imaginable
day it may be in their hearts.”</p>

<p>The kingdom of God is in our hearts, and,
if to-day we will but allow all our fellows to
share in the bounty of Nature, the kingdom
will be around us also, here and now.</p>

<p>For there is a divine order, a natural law,
obedience to which brings its own immediate
rewards; disobedience to which involves its own
punishment. The first order of Nature is that
men should derive their subsistence from the
land and the products of land, provided by an
all-wise Creator. From what else can we derive
it? Does not everything we need, from the
wheat to the wheel of the watch, come from
the earth? By many hands, by many processes,
through many stages, all forms of wealth are
obtained by labor from the land. Food, clothing,
fuel, machinery, buildings, capital are all
results of men working on the materials of the
earth. So it is clear why, when we have allowed
men to be shut out from that earth, we
find ourselves surrounded by poverty and
misery.</p>

<p>Like all fundamental laws, the law of our
economic relations is simple and easily understood,
even by children. It may be stated thus:
food, clothes, and shelter, being essential to the
maintenance of human life, all human creatures
have equal need of and, therefore, equal
right to access to the source of food, clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>271</span>
and shelter. This source is the earth, and the
only method known whereby the earth may be
made to yield food, clothes, and shelter is by
the application of labor to land. For, no matter
what picture we conjure up, whether it be
of the farmer tilling the soil, the carpenter
building a house, the factory operative weaving
cloth, the engineer driving the locomotive that
draws the produce to markets—there we find
labor. And, if we try to imagine any of these
forms of labor as cut off from land, we shall
find our very concept of labor and of life wiped
out.</p>

<p>Everything necessary to life, whether it be
the life of the individual, the nation, or of the
whole race, can be produced by the combination
of land and labor. Anything that restricts or
hampers the application of labor to land leads
to suffering on the part of those deprived of
this access. When the government of a new
country wants to increase population, it offers
free land to settlers. It does not say, “If you
will come to this country, the government will
build mills, factories, stores, offices, banks, and
churches for you”; it says rather, “Here is
land, come and use it; build for yourselves out
of its materials.” All other forms of prosperity
flow from the application of labor to
land, and, therefore, it is sufficient to give to
men free access to natural opportunities. If
the government of a country owned all the land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>272</span>
of that country, it could increase, restrict, or
otherwise regulate population, and better or
worsen the condition of that population by the
way in which it granted or withheld the land
under its control.</p>

<p>This is in effect what government has done.
It first bettered conditions by allowing free access
to land, and then worsened them by allowing
a few to make the land their private property;
this appropriation of the land carries
with it the power to hold it out of use, thus
depriving all men of their equal right to the use
of the earth, the source of supply for all men’s
wants. Instead of these favored few being
made to pay those deprived of the land an
equivalent for the privilege enjoyed, the disinherited
many are compelled to pay a premium
to the landholder for the opportunity to labor.</p>

<p>When there is a lockout, is it not the pressure
of want that brings the men back, hat in hand,
to the factory door? If one could go to the outskirts
of this town to cultivate a bit of the unused
land, could he not hold out till he got all
that his labor was worth? And, when he and his
fellows are offered less, if they could but get
at the unused mines and quarries and coalfields
and factory sites, and vacant lots, they
would not need to seek an employer at all—they
could get credit, if needed, and produce for
themselves the capital which they now produce
for others and employ themselves in doing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>273</span></p>

<p>So many evils flow from the fundamental
wrong of shutting up the earth, that rest, the
peace of mind and body that makes for refreshing
sleep, is to many impossible.</p>

<p>And who that understands would wish it otherwise?
Were the power of rest and peace universal
now, it would be a denial of the very
cause of rest,—the proper understanding of
man’s relations to humanity and to life. Until
man has adjusted his economic contrivances
to the underlying laws of a true Social Science,
he cannot have national or racial rest. The
material science, biology, is proving this ethical
truth. Recently Dr. Woods Hutchinson has
shown that it does not take even three generations
to make a high-class man a “thoroughbred,” as he terms it. If good food, light, air,
proper clothing, and wholesome recreation were
extended to the masses, each generation would
produce its own “thoroughbreds” from the
“common people.”
He says: “Men not only can but do get to
be as able, as useful, and as desirable citizens
for the community, in every possible regard,
in one generation as they will ever get or are
capable of becoming. Give the unspoiled, warm-hearted
mass of humanity a fair living chance—good
food, fresh air, sunshine, decent homes,
no overwork, plenty of healthful amusements—and
you will reap a far larger crop not merely
of happiness, of justice, and of well-being, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>274</span>
also of geniuses, of great men and of all leaders
and illuminators than any nation can possibly
utilize.”</p>

<p>Until the privilege-created aristocracy of
other countries and plutocracy of this country
get off the backs of the people and cease to
exploit them by monopolies, there can be no
complete and permanent rest, for the “mania
for owning things” possesses the rich, and the
fear of want makes restlessness for the poor.
The burden-bearing masses have not yet seen
the cause of their burden, even though they feel
its intolerable weight at times and make efforts
to throw it off. All this deepens their unrest.</p>

<p>The very oneness of all life will put sound
sleep and true rest ever beyond the general
reach until all are given equal opportunity in
Nature’s great gift to man, the Earth.</p>

<p>Then the worker, free of the taxes of rent
and monopoly, free of cut-throat competition
forced by monopoly, would have some leisure in
which to use his brains and cultivate his affections;
and liberty—moral, intellectual, and economic—would
be here.</p>

<p>Was it not something like this which Jesus
had in mind when he said “the Kingdom of
God is at hand”? Did not he say that obedience
to the laws of the Universe would bring
their own immediate and immense reward?
The kingdom and the peace of God is within
our reach, did we but realize it.</p>

<small>“IF HE SLEEP, HE SHALL DO WELL”</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! thou best comforter of that sad heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whom Fortune’s spite assails; come, gentle sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The weary mourner soothe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tighe.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span>  believe in a ruling Principle of Order
in the Universe, in accordance with
which everything lives and moves—planets,
plants, and man.</p>

<p>We call this “God,” “the Spirit,” the “Nature
of Things,” or by some other name, but
we find that, in crystal, vegetable, or animal, it
always works: and we see that it tends forever
toward a more harmonious arrangement and
better relations of the whole system.</p>

<p>There are seeming lapses, where we cannot
yet see, in this instance or in that, how it will
work out; but in the arrangement of the stars,
the growth of knowledge through experience,
and in the history of man, we see in the
broad view that it does so work out well. Probably
Mary, certainly the disciples, thought at
the time that the death of Jesus was a horrible
mistake and misfortune. Now we see that it
was “needful that this one man should die for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>276</span>
all the people” and that to him, even then, it
was no misfortune. The sacrifice of one for
many is a great principle of life. The development
of the earth from chaos to fruitfulness,
the development of man from brutality to the
rule of mind, the development of ourselves
from single selfishness to the wider love, shows
that there is a beneficent Force and that “all
things work together for good.” If each of us
considers himself alone, as having separate interests,
this truth will be obscured; but when we
recognize that each of us is a part of the whole,
as the tongue is a part of the body, we see that
no part can be favored without injuring the entire
system.</p>

<p>If we unduly gratify the taste, the tongue
is the very first to show that the stomach is
“out of order,” and this disharmony is felt in
the whole body.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have done wrong, or have seen
others do wrong apparently with profit; but the
wider view will always show that the way of
the transgressor is as hard as his heart, that
the wicked man is in truth the fool. We know
that any attempt that man makes to disturb the
right order for the sake of any separate interest
must react upon himself, destroying his own
happiness as well as the happiness of those
about him.</p>

<p>Similarly we see that the prophet, the cultivator,
the inventor, the martyr, the benevolent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>277</span>
man, each doing what he is inspired to do, is
working just as much for all mankind as for
himself, that he cannot reap the benefit except
as others share it. For our good, we are joined
together in one connected whole, so that no man
liveth, or so much as dieth, to himself.</p>

<p>We see how the Spirit makes “even the
wrath of men to praise him”  that the tyranny
of a king was necessary to drive out colonists
to proclaim liberty, and the fierce rivalry of nations
in armament is needed to usher in a Court
of International Peace. Since that is so, since
we know that in great or universal affairs the
eternal purposes cannot be interfered with, why
should we think that it fails to work in our
own little interests?</p>

<p>We see beautiful, symmetrical shells and
well-adapted organs in creatures so small that
we know of their existence only through high-power
microscopes. In them we find the same
rule of law, the same adaptation to supreme
ends that we find in the measureless suns and
in the measureless souls of men.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when what seems evil “happens,” as we say, to us, upon what principle
can we conclude that this is an exception, that
in this case something has occurred that ought
not to have occurred? If one thing went wrong
in the divine intent, it would show a limit to
the rule of Good. We know that there can be
no such limit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>278</span></p>

<p>It is not fatalism to believe that the same
holy order rules over us, for each of us and
each of our efforts is a part of the divine plan,
and a means of carrying it out. We should
strive for those things that seem to us desirable
and good; although we may not have success,
as we call it, so kind is the constitution of
things that the effort to direct things right dulls
the pain of finding that the event shapes itself
in a way that we do not like.</p>

<p>We are threatened, perhaps, with what seems
a horrible disaster: why, the very derivation of
the word disaster refers to the influence which
the stars are supposed to have upon our destinies.
Some power there is that controls those
destinies, in spite of our human limitations of
time and space. Who would take the job,
though he had the power, of controlling even
the material world, arranging the growth of
plants, the rise and fall of nations, the birth
and waning of the stars?</p>

<p>Yet we do wish to assume just such Omnipotence
and Omniscience in our personal affairs;
to say that this possession must not, shall not
slip from me, this one must not die. And, if
this that is so dear does go away, then in that
one instance, because it concerns us, we refuse
to admit that that instance is no exception to
the rule of Love, or to recognize the kind watchfulness
of Him that, keeping Israel, slumbers
not nor sleeps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>279</span></p>

<p>And yet the loss hurts, and the fear of it
hurts still more, with a pain that seems past
endurance—it hurts, and for ages long it has
been necessary that we should have just such
pain in order that we may make the efforts that
contribute our part to the progress of the
world.</p>

<p>But some of us do not in our hearts believe
in a beneficent Order of the Universe. We think
that some persons may seize what they want,
regardless of others, and yet no evil come to
them. Even if that be so, still it is wise to act
so as to gain the most happiness and, therefore,
to accommodate ourselves to the Nature of
Things.</p>

<p>If we could but leave out the unreasonable
self-pity and get into our hearts, as knowledge
that is a part of ourselves, this understanding
of the goodness and the loving kindness of God,
we should be as gods ourselves, seeing the end
from the beginning and recognizing that, success
or failure, loss or gain, life or death, the
times are in his hands, and it is all very good.
And our hearts should not be troubled, nor our
rest disturbed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span>  have finished our long inquiry, and it

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Much of the ground we have merely passed
over, it may be hurriedly, but we have seen
a promised land of Peace, and, wherever the
soles of our feet have trodden, the land shall
be given to us and to our children for an inheritance—if
we will.</p>

<p>Now, once again, dear reader—dear, for, in
striving and in helping each other to get a clear
view of these important matters, we become
dear to each other—try these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>281</span></p>

<p>If you have read and merely approved or disapproved,
you will get little good from the
reading. You remember the pathetically comic
story of the little boy who was asked if his father
was a Christian:</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “pa is a Christian; but he
does not work much at it.” That man might
more hopefully have been an infidel. You must
put all that you can accept into practice if it is
to be of any use.</p>

<p>We have found that what we call body and
mind and soul are so closely bound together
that no one of them can be well or ill independently
of the others. We divide them in our
thought and speech; but we cannot find any line
of separation. Every state joins on to the next
one: mineral and vegetable and animal are
composed of the same elements which pass from
one state to another. The silex and the lime
are taken up to make the wheat hard, we eat
wheat and these elements pass into our bones,
and, when our bodies return to Mother Earth,
the rootlets take them up again to run the round
once more.</p>

<p>So the body and mind and soul are all one
Life. There are no divisions in Nature. The
form differs, but the essence is uniform. We
classify for the sake of convenience and of clear
statement. As Sir Oliver Lodge says, in “The
Survival of Man”—“Boundaries and classifications
must be recognized as human artifices,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>282</span>
but for practical purposes distinctions are necessary”;
but the philosopher never loses sight
of the fundamental fact that each animal, flying-fish
and whale, seal and polar bear, bat and
bird, can be classified only by seizing on some
acquired characteristic, such as the temperature
of the blood, the method of birth, or the
structure of the bones. These mark the animal
as belonging to an order.</p>

<p>We see, then, that all are One, different manifestations
of the Universal Life, which must be
understood and treated as a whole to see and
avail ourselves of the Universal Harmony. Accordingly
we find that we must work with Nature
if she is to bring forth abundantly, of
bodily or of spiritual things, to satisfy our
desires. Only in the sweat of our faces do we
absorb the full comfort and strength of the
bread of life.</p>

<p>Whatever you have willingly received, willingly
give to others. Only when you cast the
seed, this your mental bread, upon the fertilizing
waters, shall it return to you in the
harvest after many days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What I have written, I have written as much
for myself as for you: if it were not so,
it would be useless both to you and to me. We
must go up each for himself and take the
strongholds of our own Ignorance and Distrust
and Fear. Let no one think that he can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>283</span>
get life by merely reading these words of
life.</p>

<p>Try these things for yourself—teach these
things to your other selves; breathe them in
and live them out. Open your mind and enlarge
your heart so that the Spirit may be able
to bless you and keep you with him, and to be
kind to you, and to lift up the Light of his countenance
upon you and give you</p>

<p>The “Dictionary of Psychological Medicine” (1892), giving the terms used in medical psychology
with the symptoms, treatment, and pathology of insanity.
Two vols. Edited by D. Hack Tuke, M.D.,
LL.D., Examiner in Mental Psychology in the University
of London; lecturer on Psychological Medicine,
etc., says:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loss of Sleep as a Cause and Consequence of
Insanity</span>: Insomnia is the indication of a morbid
condition. It is also, when prolonged, something
more. Loss of sleep may frequently be a cause, or one
of several causes, of mental disorder. To remove it
is therefore of the greatest consequence in the early
treatment of the insane. <i class="em">In a large number of instances
it is doubtless the consequence and not the
cause of mental trouble.</i> The agony of mind associated
with melancholia, or the rapid flow of ideas in
acute mania, may render sleep an almost unattainable
boon, and in these cases it requires great discrimination
to decide when, if at all, to administer hypnotics.
(P. 1173.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedies Known as Somnifacients, Soporifics,
Hypnotics, and Narcotics</span>: At the outset we must
put the question, Is there a distinction between hypnotics
and narcotics? Dujardin-Beaumetz answers in
the affirmative. He holds that for the drug to be hypnotic
it must imitate the natural condition of sleep
by effecting a lowered intra-cranial pressure, and that
drugs which, though bringing about unconsciousness,
do not lower cerebral pressure, or which increase it,
cannot claim to be hypnotics. On this line he sepa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>286</span>rates
chloral as a hypnotic from opium as a narcotic
... in the different forms of artificial or drugged
sleep it is probable that these two factors—quantity
of blood, including blood pressure, and quality of
blood, do each play a part. (P. 1129.)</p>

<p>Medical science has been able so far to do little for
sleeplessness, except to call it “Insomnia.”
<span class="smcap">Insomnia</span>: Loss of sleep has been classified under
various heads by writers on wakefulness. Thus
German-Sée has made no less than nine divisions:</p>

<p>a—dolorous insomnia.</p>

<p>b—digestive.</p>

<p>c—cardiac and dyspnoeal insomnia.</p>

<p>d—cerebros-spinal, neurotic insomnia comprising
lesions of encephalon, general paralysis, acute and
chronic mania, hysteria, hypochondriasis.</p>

<p>e—psychic insomnia (emotional and sensational).</p>

<p>f—insomnia of cerebral and physical fatigue.</p>

<p>g—genito-urinary insomnia.</p>

<p>h—febrile, infectious, autotoxic insomnia.</p>

<p>i—toxic insomnia (coffee, tea, alcohol).<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Among the causes of insomnia those of a predisposing
character are the female sex, old age, nervous
temperament, intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>Of exciting causes may be enumerated organic or
functional diseases of the brain, worry, anxiety, grief,
and bodily pain; noise, if not monotonous, fever, coffee,
tea, etc.</p>

<p>Among the insane, insomnia is one of the most frequent
symptoms, except in chronic dementia. In
melancholia it is the most distressing accompaniment
of the disorder, and is especially marked in the early
morning.</p>

<p>A careful analysis of the conditions or causes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>287</span>
insomnia has been made by Dr. Folsom (U. S.). The
principal ones may be briefly enumerated as follows:
Habit, reflex causes, as indigestion, genito-urinary disorders;
autotoxic causes, as gout, lithæmia, syphilis,
habitual constipation; anæmia, vaso-motor changes,
neurasthenia, hallucinations of sight or hearing, astigmatism—the
strain of the eye which in health may
be unnoticed, producing “in states of debility, headache,
dizziness, spasmodic muscular action or wakefulness”
and the neurotic temperament.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<small>ABSTRACT FROM ARTICLE: “LUMINOUS
SLEEP”</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">P. Arunochalam</span></p>


<p>Deep sleep is a sleep of darkness, that is, the sleep
of the nerves, and the utter relaxation of the body.
Its refreshment is due to absence of thought.</p>

<p>Is there a sleep of light, a luminous sleep, in which,
while there is absence of thought, there is not darkness
and oblivion, but perfect consciousness? To suppose
this did not seem irrational to the Greeks. (An instance
is cited of the abstracted moods of Socrates,
Sympos: 174-5.) (Further citations of this eccentricity
of Socrates are in: The Tamil Sage; Charmides;
Phaedrus; The Republic; also Tennyson, “The
Ancient Sage.”)</p>

<p>This reality, sleep that is a sort of abstraction from
the bodily condition, is pure consciousness of spirit,
“Luminous sleep,” an intellectual and spiritual condition
as contrasted with physical sleep. To the gen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>288</span>eral
aspects of the genius and life of Ancient Greece,
to its philosophy of the reality of pure abstraction,
of absolute knowledge and the possibility of attaining
it, such a theory would seem reasonable.</p>

<p>Dr. Jowett is cited as maintaining that pure abstraction
is mere negation.</p>

<h4>PREFACE</h4>

<p>That it may well be difficult to explain the nature,
differences, causes, and importance of sleep and waking,
I think is made clear enough by the fact that
concerning them there is great doubt and dissension
among the highest philosophers and physicians. For
Galen, when he questioned what sleep was, and what
waking, decided at length that he could not be certain
in what order of phenomena to classify them. Aristotle
indeed, in his definitions of sleep and waking,
arranges them in different places. Judging from
selected books of all authors, no one, in my opinion,
has been able to enumerate the general differences of
sleep and waking by any certain method. Alcmœn
thinks sleep is produced when the blood in the veins
flows back and becomes congested. Empedocles
believes it to arise from the chilling of heat in the
blood. Diogenes states that sleep is induced by the
blood pushing to the inner cavities of the body the
air that is introduced into bodies. Plato and the
Stoics taught that it arose of itself by the letting go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>289</span>
of the spirit (or the releasing of the breath) and the
consequent relaxation.</p>

<p>It is needless to refute the cause which Aristotle
gives for sleep, and Galen for waking. They do not
accord. The one thinks the true cause arises and has
its seat in the heart,—the other in the brain. On
account of which disagreement, great contention has
been excited among more recent philosophers and
physicians, as to which view to adhere to. Some attribute
one significance, others another to these things.
And so, because of the great difficulty introduced,
there is nothing relative to the matter which is not in
the deepest obscurity and doubt. A knowledge of this
thing is, nevertheless, most useful, even if come upon
by any other fortunate means, and not only through
the knowledge of the doctors; by such means, for instance,
as through the study of the general arts; for
if it is joyful to philosophize, and to happen upon the
hidden and abstruse things in the secret places of
nature,—who would not find great pleasure in learning
the causes of the sleeping and waking of creatures,
why now they take long, now short sleeps; why at
one time it is difficult to capture sleep,—at another
time impossible to dispel it?</p>

<p>We wonder how at one moment sleep leads to waking;
how waking and sleeping mutually succeed each
other; why diverse things serve to explain each other,
as sleep, waking,—and waking, sleep.</p>

<p>Sometimes these, sleep and waking, are injurious,—at
other times beneficial. For sleep and also waking
bring forth diseases, intensify them; both equally
drive them away, soothe sorrows and likewise intensify
them; by one and the other alike, morbid
causes are often destroyed more effectually than by
any other remedy; indeed, in conjunction with the
benefit of these (sleep and waking), concoctions, food,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>290</span>
purgatives, and finally all the functions of the different
parts of the body may be exercised to the best
advantage; nor is it possible, indeed, for a creature to
live, or to maintain his life, without sleep and waking.</p>

<p>There is no action of the body or mind which has
greater values to the body, nothing which supplies
more reliable signs for discerning bodily ills, and
showing how to be rid of them.</p>

<p>Of which things, indeed, the investigation and
knowledge is most useful, and not without pleasure
to those who delight in the understanding of things;
that is what Aristotle, prince of philosophers, notices,
when he writes his whole book concerning sleep and
waking,—and often elsewhere at random in his writings.
Not the less does Hippocrates notice them in his
citations, for he wrote most sayings on the subject,
so many that I omit them; and there are many in
other books, of which a definite impression does not
remain in my memory. But as I have said, when all,
or certainly most writers on this subject may be perplexed
with regard to these things, and involved in
many difficulties, no one ought to condemn me, if,
after them, and many men, I presume to write on this
subject.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>BY WHAT CAUSES AND MEANS SLEEP AND WAKING ARE
PRODUCED, ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF ARISTOTLE</small></h4>

<p>To refute the opinion of the philosophers concerning
the causes of sleep and waking, I think superfluous;
because, with Aristotle’s views surviving now many
centuries, no authority among these other writers
may be greater than his; and because the ignorant
premises of the others makes all discussion of them
become inane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>291</span></p>

<p>Because of this I think I should be excused for introducing
the opinion of Aristotle among all the
philosophers, that is, for choosing it from among them,
for if we show it to be equally probable with the
others which we presume to refute, it will be because,
unlike them, it extinguishes them by its own plausibility.</p>

<p>Aristotle thinks sleep to be produced by a vapor
generated by the heat energy in food, the fumes of
which, rising to the brain, are there converted into
moisture by the coldness of the brain itself, because,
as he says, cold is felt at the contact just as rain is
known to be made from vapor in contact with cold
air; which moisture or humor, by force of gravity, is
pushed downward, descends through the veins, drives
the heat from the heart, and makes that cold also;
whence, the cold spreading about, sleep, he says, generally
arises.</p>

<p>This moisture, or humor,—ought to be warm, he
writes; when it is cold, sleep will not be produced,—just
as those affected with sleepiness show that their
systems are in warm and at the same time humid
condition; and children, who have abundance of this
warm moisture, sleep the most; whence he states that
this sleep chill has in fact its causes at the outset in
this very warmth. These things he discusses partly
in the book on “Sleep and Waking,” partly in the
second of “The Parts of Animals,” and in “Problems.” I am not able to judge concerning the first
matter, the idea of giving a single cause of sleep.
For, according to this author, waking brings sleep;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
since even animals, by means of waking and exercising
their functions are known to become quiet and sleep,
and it is said by him, that since animals become help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>292</span>less
in sleep, this helplessness is produced by the
excess of waking that precedes it.</p>

<p>But not in waking, in food, or in this reason of
generated vapor, is it possible to place the cause of
sleep. Exercise produces this very effect. For
through labor, deep and sweetest sleep falls upon the
creatures; and this not on account of vapors rising
from food, nor on account of a natural moisture, so
much as by the violent exercise of the body. Foods
that are cold or dried, as the hull of the mandrake,—taken
into the body, induce sleep; which therefore is
not accomplished because these foods give rise to
vapors, since they would rather banish the vapors by
their dryness; nor would these foods supply to the
head what vapor is generated, since, repelled by the
cold of such substances being taken into the body, the
moisture would be repelled and chilled, and prevent
the vapor from being carried to the brain. This
would be so, as he says, only if the generation of
vapors, and their ascent arose from the heating of
this natural humor or moisture.</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL REMARKS</h4>

<p>At the date of going to press we have not received
answers sufficient in number to warrant very definite
statements in regard to sleep and dreams. A thorough
report must be reserved for a later edition. Nor
was the time sufficient for the very considerable labor
of examining and tabulating the replies. It appears,
however, that about one person in thirty regards himself
as a poor sleeper, and only two others in thirty
will say they sleep only fairly well. About three
persons out of five report that they spend no time
in wakefulness in bed; the remaining two persons
spend from fifteen minutes to five or six hours each,
the average among this group being one hour and ten
minutes per person per night. Among professors in
our leading universities the prevailing hour for retiring
is between 10 and 11 o’clock; four-fifths of
this group say they retire either at 10, 10.30, or 11
o’clock; but this class of people retire on the average
about one-half hour later than persons of the other
classes from whom we have received replies.</p>

<p>The average duration of sleep is, roughly, seven
and one-half hours. One-third of all replies gave
eight hours as the length of sleep; and the professors
are inclined to sleep a slightly longer period than
those in the other occupations taken together.</p>

<p>The age of the individuals seemed to have no effect
on the averages of the daily amount of time spent in
sleep. Persons under the age of forty differed in no
marked degree from persons over forty either in
length of sleep or frequency of dreaming. There is
general agreement on the point that they get just
enough sleep, and that vacations make only a slight
increase. The data is not yet sufficient to justify a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>296</span>
conclusion as to the average time of sleep at different
ages.</p>

<p>In reference to dreams, about 15 per cent. report
that they do not dream, and about 30 per cent. say
they dream “rarely,” “seldom,” or “occasionally.” We are disposed to question these returns on the
ground that they give an impression that dreams are
less frequent than they really are. The investigations
of most experimenters who have made special
studies of dreams seem rather to show that the number
of our dream-experiences grows as soon as we
give our attention to them, just as, on a clear night, a
hasty glance at the sky may reveal many stars, but
a steady gaze reveals very many more.</p>

<p>Our returns are interesting as to the character of
the dreams. The favorite adjective used to describe
dreams was “rational.” A lesser number of persons
said their dreams were “pleasant,” less still that
they were “fantastic.” Three times as many persons
describe their dreams as pleasant than those who
describe them as generally unpleasant. Either Professor
Freud’s conclusion is correct, that we tend to
forget unpleasant experiences more readily than
pleasant ones, or else the dreams really afforded more
pleasurable than they did disagreeable feelings. The
most typical combination used to describe the nature
of the individual’s dream-life was that it was “rational
and pleasant.” Less than one-third of all the
answerers confessed to having ever experienced nightmare.</p>

<p>It should be observed that thus far we have encountered
a group of replies from persons who, as a
group, are remarkably healthy, normal, and fairly
free from worry. Particularly, worry does not seem
to be a vice of professors, as only 8 per cent. confess
to it. About 17 per cent. of them say they need more
physical exercise than they get, which is mostly walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>297</span>ing.
There is also a gratifying unanimity as to good
appetite, simple diet, and absence of need for artificial
means of inducing sleep.</p>

<p>It is surprising how little has been written about
Sleep, and what a small part of what has been written
is worth reading. Perhaps the best book, certainly
the most exhaustive, is Marie Manacéïne’s “Sleep,” which contains a full but disorderly Bibliography.</p>

<p>Except in the case of American works, which might
easily have escaped Marie Manacéïne’s attention, I
have not tried to go further back than that Bibliography,
as she was most industrious in research;
I have only cut out from her list what seemed the
more obsolete or needless works. But with the help of
A. T. Craig and others, I have carried it, as far as
may be, down to date.</p>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
